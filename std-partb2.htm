        <h2>Changes since 2011 in <i>Six Times a Day</i> (6TD)</h2>

        <p>Bust sizes, rather than just bra-cup sizes, are now specified for the women. Many of these are changed from the prior version of 6TD for two reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the bra cup sizing system has been changed from a complex U.K. system to a more-readily-understood U.S. system, which is consistent with 6TD occurring on the U.S. West Coast; and<br />
          &nbsp;</li>

          <li>the band and bra sizes of some of the larger-busted women have changed to reflect their height and proportional rib-cage and chest sizes, as well as their individual genetic heritage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All changes in bust size were made on the advice of a similarly large-busted young woman who has recently joined the 6TD <i>Staff</i>, followed by much discussion on <a href="http://six.clubetchi.com/forum/index.php?/topic/926-breast-resizing-in-std/">this forum thread.</a></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Alan's class schedule plays a major role in 6TD. Thus it has been added near the end of the Characters page, Page b2, as a new class of 'Characters'.</p>

        <p>The Plummer and Pestridge houses and grounds play a major role in 6TD. Thus they are being added to the end of the Characters page as another new class of 'Characters'.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Major and minor characters</h2>

        <p>Where worth noting, ages as of the start of 6TD are in parentheses. Heights of significant characters are given in both English and metric units. Bra cup sizes in this story now use this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement#Cup_sizes_vary">U.S. scheme</a>. Those used herein are B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J. Sizes specified below are as of the start of 6TD. In two cases those sizes change during the three months of 6TD Proper; those changes (but not their causes or when they occur) are also noted.</p>

        <p>In this story, only female faces are pictured.</p>

      <div class="Alan Katherine Ron Susan">
        <h2 id="plummers">The Plummer Family:</h2>

        <p>Alan Evan Plummer (18): Adopted son of Susan and Ron, brother of Katherine. Nicknamed "Tiger" by his mother Susan, and "Sweetie" by Suzanne, the mother of the family that lives next door. His real parents are unknown. He has surprisingly dark skin, implying a probable Mediterranean or Middle Eastern ethnicity. He's six foot one (185&nbsp;cm) and still growing into his body, but nonetheless quite handsome. He has short but unkempt dark brown hair and brown eyes<span class="hidden"> and is a Leo</span>. He's a high school senior, active in scouting, who has gone out for tennis.</p>

        <img id="kath000c" class="center" src="partb2/kath000c.jpg" title="kath000c" alt="Katherine" />

        <p>Katherine Anne Plummer (17): Adopted daughter of Susan and Ron, sister of Alan. Nicknamed "Angel" by her mother Susan. A high school junior and member of the cheerleading squad. Five foot eleven (180&nbsp;cm); natural 34D bust; long, straight, dark brown hair; dark brown eyes; medium tanned skin<span class="hidden">; Leo</span>.</p>

        <p>Ron Plummer (41): Husband of Susan, adoptive father of Alan and Katherine. He mostly lives overseas in Asia, where he does business for extended periods of time. He has almost no involvement with his family.</p>

        <img id="susan000c" class="center" src="partb2/susan000c.jpg" title="susan000c" alt="Susan" />

        <p>Susan Plummer (37): Adoptive mother of Alan and Katherine, next door neighbor and best friend to Suzanne. Unhappily married to Ron. She's had a very prudish and conservative religious upbringing in the rural Midwest (Nebraska). Called "Aunt Susan" by Amy. Five foot eleven (180&nbsp;cm); natural 38G bust, which increases to 38I during 6TD Proper; long, straight, dark brown hair; dark brown eyes; fair skin<span class="hidden">; Cancer</span>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="Amy Brad Eric Suzanne">
        <h2 id="pestridges">The Pestridge Family:</h2>

        <img id="amy000c" class="center" src="partb2/amy000c.jpg" title="amy000c" alt="Amy" />

        <p>Amy Pestridge (17): Daughter of Suzanne and Eric, sister of Brad, Katherine's best friend, a high school cheerleader. Since she seems very na&iuml;ve and was once the victim of an attempted sexual assault, her mother Suzanne, her neighbors Katherine, Alan and Susan, and her female classmates all act as her protectors. Nicknamed "Honey Pie" by her mother. A high school senior and member of the cheerleading squad, she has a near-constant smile. Five foot eight (173&nbsp;cm); natural 36D bust, which increases to 36E during 6TD Proper; medium length, amber/copper-colored hair; hazel eyes; light skin<span class="hidden">; Leo</span>.</p>

        <p>Brad Pestridge (18): Son of Suzanne and Eric, brother of Amy. He's not close to either his mother, his sister or the Plummers. He and Amy hardly even look like siblings and have almost nothing in common. A member of the high school football team.</p>

        <p>Eric Pestridge (44): Husband of Suzanne, father of Amy and Brad. Devoted to his highly successful business, he is rarely home. His marriage with Suzanne has been a loveless one for many years, and they sleep in separate beds.</p>

        <img id="suzanne000c" class="center" src="partb2/suzanne000c.jpg" title="suzanne000c" alt="Suzanne" />

        <p>Suzanne Pestridge (39): Mother of Amy and Brad. Next-door neighbor and best friend to Susan. Unhappily married to Eric. Her firm, high tits highlight her voluptuous body, just like Susan, and in fact their bodies are nearly the exact same size in every way. She's very sexually experienced and constantly scheming and cheating on her husband. Called "Aunt Suzy" by Alan and Katherine. Five foot eleven (180&nbsp;cm); natural 38G bust; very dark reddish-brown hair; green eyes; extremely pale skin<span class="hidden">; Capricorn</span>. Like her former college roommate Xania, she has a very long and agile tongue.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="Akami Dr.&nbsp;Fredrickson">
        <h2 id="medical_office">The Doctor's Office:</h2>

        <p>Dr. Wilt Fredrickson (40): A doctor who has mostly geriatric patients. A player. Suzanne has arranged for Alan to become his patient.</p>

        <img id="akami000c" class="center" src="partb2/akami000c.jpg" title="akami000c" alt="Akami" />

        <p>Akami Fubuki (32): Dr. Fredrickson's nurse. She's half Japanese, half Caucasian, and the mistress of the married Dr. Fredrickson. Five foot six (167&nbsp;cm); natural 32B bust; black hair; black eyes; Japanese skin tone.</p>
      </div>

        <img id="glory000c" class="center" src="partb2/glory000c.jpg" title="glory000c" alt="Glory" />

        <p>Gloria (Glory) Rhymer (27): She is Alan's fourth-period world-history teacher and his first serious crush. She's a typical California surfer girl outside the classroom and is even nicknamed "Surfer Girl" by some friends and students, but she dresses and behaves very formally in school. She's unmarried but in a serious relationship at the start of this story. Five foot seven (170&nbsp;cm); natural 34C bust; wavy blonde hair; blue eyes; tanned skin<span class="hidden">; Aries</span>.</p>

        <p>Mr. Tompkins: Alan's first-period physics teacher.</p>

        <p>Mr. Jackson: Alan's elderly third-period art teacher.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Metzger: Alan's fifth-period calculus teacher.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="Heather Janice Joy Kim">
        <h2 id="other_cheerleaders">The Other High-school Cheerleaders:</h2>

        <img id="heather000c" class="center" src="partb2/heather000c.jpg" title="heather000c" alt="Heather" />

        <p>Heather Morgan (18): The head cheerleader, de-facto social queen of the high school, and girlfriend of "Rock" Rockwell, the football quarterback. She has a forceful and charismatic personality. Helped by a large following of groupies, she exerts wide-reaching influence over events at school. She's bisexual and very sexually active, with many partners, yet has somehow managed to keep her promiscuity from becoming common knowledge. She's a high school senior. Five foot nine (175&nbsp;cm); 36E bust, enhanced from 34C; long blonde hair (dyed); blue eyes; exceptionally tanned skin<span class="hidden">; Leo</span>.</p>

        <img id="kim000c" class="center" src="partb2/kim000c.jpg" title="kim000c" alt="Kim" />

        <p>Kim Fields (16): The youngest and shortest of the high school cheerleaders. An out lesbian, she is a first-year cheerleader, as are Katherine and Amy. She's a high school sophomore. Five foot four (162&nbsp;cm); natural 32B bust; long brown hair; brown eyes; light skin.</p>

        <img id="janice000c" class="center" src="partb2/janice000c.jpg" title="janice000c" alt="Janice" />

        <p>Janice Drake (17 or 18): Best friends with Joy. She's a high school junior. Five foot six (167&nbsp;cm); natural 32B bust; short red hair; green eyes; pale skin. She loathes Heather but has an unrequited crush on Joy.</p>

        <img id="joy000c" class="center" src="partb2/joy000c.jpg" title="joy000c" alt="Joy" />

      </div>

      <div class="Ivan Rock Ryan">
        <h2 id="football_players">The Football Players:</h2>

        <p>"Rock" Rockwell (18): The high school quarterback and Heather's boyfriend. De-facto leader of the "jocks" in the school, primarily due to his skill on the field. He doesn't realize it, but his relationship with Heather is a complete sham, with Heather using him mostly to boost her own popularity. He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.</p>

        <p>Ryan (18): A defensive lineman for the high school football team. He's very big but also clever. He's the organizer of plots against Alan.</p>

        <p>Ivan Fedorov (18): A wide receiver for the high school football team who is faster than, but not as big as, Ryan. Brighter than Rock, but not by much.</p>

        <p>Jerry (18): Another lineman for the high school football team who is very big but comparatively stupid. He's central in some of the plots against Alan.</p>

        <p>Gary (18): Another lineman for the high school football team who is openly gay.</p>

        <p>Aaron (19): A gigantic defensive lineman from another school who is recruited to help attack Alan. He already has a criminal record.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="Christine Dean Donna Peter Sean Simone">
        <h2 id="other_students">Other High School Students:</h2>

        <img id="christine000c" class="center" src="partb2/christine000c.jpg" title="christine000c" alt="Christine" />

        <p>Christine Anderssen (17): Alan's long-time school crush. She's a high school senior with an outstanding academic record. She's a member of the school's track and field team and also plays other sports. Although she's highly trained in martial arts, few at school even know of her interest since she never discusses that part of her life. Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful girls in the school, but has a stand-offish and blunt demeanor that has earned her the nickname "Ice Queen" Christine. Five foot nine (175&nbsp;cm); natural 38F bust; light blonde hair; blue eyes; pale skin<span class="hidden">; Capricorn</span>; very Nordic in appearance. She is the head of a school clique known as the "Goody-goodies" for being morally upright (and up-tight). She has yet to date, let alone have sex, partly because few admirers have the guts to ask her out.</p>

        <img id="donna000c" class="center" src="partb2/donna000c.jpg" title="donna000c" alt="Donna" />

        <p>Donna Giovanni (18): Heather's rival as the high school's social queen. A senior, she is very popular and has her own power base, but nonetheless plays second fiddle to Heather. Charismatic in her own right, her personality has captivated many. Five foot six (168&nbsp;cm); natural 34C bust; dark brown hair; brown eyes; olive skin.</p>

        <p>Sean Kim (18): One of Alan's best friends. He's smart and nerdy, but reasonably tall and attractive. Ethnically Korean, but thoroughly Americanized. A high school senior with a hopeless crush on Heather. He has a much younger sister named Gina.</p>

        <img id="simone000c" class="center" src="partb2/simone000c.jpg" title="simone000c" alt="Simone" />

        <p>Simone Hendrix (18): Heather's best friend since childhood and frequent sexual partner. One of the few able to tolerate Heather's personality at close range, and the only one able to speak her mind to Heather and not live to regret it. Strong sense of humor and easygoing personality. Something of a star on several school sports teams. African-American by heritage, but thoroughly "white bread" suburban upbringing. Five foot seven (170&nbsp;cm); 36E bust, slightly enhanced from a full 36D; short spiky black hair; dark brown eyes; dark brown skin<span class="hidden">; Libra</span>. While very sexually active, she prefers steadier relationships than does Heather.</p>

        <p>Dean Howell (18): Joy's boyfriend. He and Joy have an open relationship where they're allowed to have sex with others.</p>

        <p>Peter Brown (17): One of Alan's best friends. He's somewhat chubby, short, squat, and fairly hopeless with girls.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="Adrian Anika Brenda Frank Ginger Helen Lars Olga Xania">
        <h2 id="other_characters">Other Characters:</h2>

        <img id="xania000c" class="center" src="partb2/xania000c.jpg" title="xania000c" alt="Xania" />

        <p>Xania Tsakicheretakis (39): A college friend and roommate of Suzanne's who has acted in a soft-porn movie. She lives in Los Angeles, an hour away from where the others live. Suzanne gets her to pretend to be Dr. Xania Goodleigh, PhD, a psycholgist/sex-therapist whom Suzanne recommends to the Plummer family. Her body is very similar to Suzanne's and Susan's: tall, very busty, in great shape. Goodleigh (pronounced "good lay") is a joke familial name for her pretend persona, mostly because her real last name is so difficult to pronounce. Xania enjoys her acting role as a faux therapist. Six feet tall (183&nbsp;cm); natural 38G bust; long, dark brown hair; brown eyes; light skin<span class="hidden">; Sagittarius</span>. Like Suzanne, she has an extremely long and agile tongue.</p>

        <img id="brenda000c" class="center" src="partb2/brenda000c.jpg" title="brenda000c" alt="Brenda" />

        <p>Brenda Hunter (35): An acquaintance of Suzanne's. She's short and cute, with extremely large breasts. She's going through a painful divorce and stands to receive a many-million-dollar divorce settlement. Five foot five (165&nbsp;cm); natural 34J bust; short, dark brown hair; blue eyes; light skin<span class="hidden">; Taurus</span>.</p>

        <p>Adrian Hunter (16): Brenda's only son. He lives alone with Brenda while they wait for Brenda's divorce to be finalized. He's shy, timid, and completely inexperienced sexually. Although he goes to the same high school as the other characters, he's only a sophomore and thus doesn't know any of them personally.</p>

        <p>Anika (64): The live-in housekeeper and cook in Brenda's mansion. Originally from Austria, she still speaks with a heavy accent. While old, she is still spry and healthy. Having served Brenda and her family since Brenda's childhood, she is more than just hired help, so serves as a substitute mother of sorts to Brenda, because Brenda's mother passed away while Brenda was still a teen.</p>

        <img id="ginger000c" class="center" src="partb2/ginger000c.jpg" title="ginger000c" alt="Ginger" />

        <p>Ginger Godfrey (21): An attractive employee working at Stephanie's, a nearby lingerie and sex shop. She's bisexual and very sexually daring, heavily into S-and-M. Five foot seven (170&nbsp;cm); natural 34C bust; long, colored blonde hair; brown eyes; tanned skin.</p>

        <p>Olga Anderssen (45): Christine's mother. She a first-generation immigrant from Norway; five foot ten (177&nbsp;cm); natural 40D bust. Her appearance is very similar to Christine, including similar, long, light blonde hair with curly locks. She has a strong, loving relationship with her daughter, and a good marriage to her husband.</p>

        <p>Lars Anderssen (47): Christine's father. He's a first-generation immigrant from Norway.</p>

        <p>Kirsten Gustafson (25): Christine's widowed aunt. She lives nearby and is one of Christine's few close friends. A former model with a year-old baby fathered by her recently deceased husband, she's six foot two (188 cm), blonde, with shapely long legs; natural 36E bust.</p>

        <img id="helen000c" class="center" src="partb2/helen000c.jpg" title="helen000c" alt="Helen" />

        <p>Helen Morgan (39): Heather's mother. She's beautiful, blonde, and bitchy, just like her daughter. She was wild like Heather when she was a teen. However, she loves her long-time husband Frank, so is mostly loyal to him. She's five foot nine (175&nbsp;cm); tanned; with a natural 36D bust.</p>

        <p>Frank Morgan (42): Heather's father. He's a large former Marine officer, a Captain who had commanded a Marine rifle company in the first Gulf war. He's prone to anger and jealousy.</p>

        <p>Why this addition? The effort to revise 6TD accelerated in 2011, when many more missing scenes were added to the early parts. In early 2012 a new team of proofreaders was recruited to review the revised text, identify inconsistencies within the story or between the text and illustrations, and recommend corrections to either or both. Within a month or two this had progressed to the point where it became critical to reconcile the various descriptions of the Plummer house and grounds. One new proofreader, Magoo, took on the task of uncovering all the constraints on the Plummer house. Another new proofreader, Mick, used those constraints to create a plausible house plan that could meet structural and building code requirements. After many iterations this converged to the Plummer house plan found below.</p>

        <p>Once the Plummer house plan had largely stabilized, Magoo reviewed all the illustrations for the revised parts and identified their context in the 6TD text, which Spacer then used to reconcile the image backgrounds and the text where possible.</p>

        <p>This process is expected to continue as other parts are revised. It is planned to apply the same process to the grounds of the Plummer and Pestridge houses, and to those parts of the Pestridge house that play an important role in 6TD.</p>

        <p><strong>These designs are preliminary and incomplete.</strong> They will be updated whenever newer versions are available. The designations of the floors as "upper" and "ground" attempt to avoid the differences in floor nomenclature between the U.S. and many other parts of the world, which disagree on which floor would be correctly labeled the "first" floor.</p>

      <p class="credits">NOTE: Thanks to Mick for his expertise in creating plausible, structurally sound house plans and yard layouts, and to Magoo for collecting all the constraints within 6TD on the houses, reviewing all the images, and driving the process of making the images and backgrounds consistent with Mick's layouts and with the 6TD text. Thanks to Jamielynn for leading a revision of the bust and bra sizes to use an understandable U.S. sizing system and to make the sizes more consistent with real-life Southern Californian women of the 21st century.</p>
