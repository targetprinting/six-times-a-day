      <h2 id="chapter_1">CHAPTER 1 (Friday, Nov. 22)</h2>

      <p>Alan had gone to sleep quite late, due to all his homework. It was nearly three in the morning when he finally went to bed, and he fell asleep instantly.</p>

      <p>Normally he was quite a deep sleeper, especially when he was so tired, so he was surprised to wake up a short time later. He was even more surprised to realize that he wasn't alone. He could tell it was Katherine merely by her smell, but he opened his eyes and looked at her body in the darkness just to be sure. He couldn't see any more than her head because the covers were pulled up, so he focused on her face. He realized she was awake. She also was a good distance from him across the bed, apparently because she didn't want to wake him up.</p>

      <p>Seeing that he'd noticed her, she gave him a nervous smile. She whispered, "Howdy, Big Palm Tree Brother. Sorry I woke you. Pretend I'm not even here." She gently scooted up to him, but then seemed content just to turn around and spoon up against him, not trying anything sexual. However, she was nude and he was nude, so the odds of them not getting sexual were pretty low.</p>

      <p>He noticed that she'd turned so his arms and chest pressed into her back instead of her more tempting front. He whispered, "But you are here. What would Mom think? I don't want to have to deal with disappointing her. There's too much going on with me right now."</p>

      <p>"Hey. My bed collapsed. What else can I do?"</p>

      <p>He smirked at that. "I can feel that you're naked too. What happened, did your wardrobe burn down as well?"</p>

      <p>She giggled. "Yeah. I had a little accident with some matches. No big deal."</p>

      <p>He couldn't help but chuckle at that. But then he was determined to stay serious. "Sis, we really shouldn't. If Mom were to-"</p>

      <img id="kath120c" class="center" src="part42a/kath120c.jpg" title="kath120c" alt="Katherine" />

      <p>Katherine turned over enough to caress his cheek with a finger. "Hey! Don't worry. She won't. I've set the alarm clock to wake up a bit before she does. I've hardly seen you lately. Can't I just enjoy a cuddle? We don't have to do anything at all, just sleep. I know you must be exhausted, so you won't hear another word from me. Goodnight, my loving big brother."</p>

      <p>She closed her eyes and made a big show of turning back over and ignoring him. Within seconds she even began to pretend snoring, but then she made herself giggle more with that, so she stopped.</p>

      <p>But she was good on her word to stay quiet.</p>

      <p>Alan lay there for a couple of minutes, but his sister didn't stir. He closed his eyes and felt the pleasant sensation of her soft, feminine body up against his from his shoulders down to his groin. His penis had gotten a bit excited, expecting action, and he was quite pleased to feel it revive after many hours of not being able to.</p>

      <p>But she seemed to act as if his erection resting between her ass cheeks wasn't there.</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>Boy. Sleeping with my sister. This is wild. For someone with so much sexual experience lately, it sure is strange how rarely I've slept the night in the same bed with a woman. There's only been that one night with Amy.</em></p>

      <p><em>It sure feels good, though. Reassuring. It makes me feel loved. I know Sis loves me so much. How lucky am I to have possibly the best looking girl in the whole school as my sister? Not to mention the other best looking one as my girlfriend. And then the other best looking one, Heather, is my bitch! ... Of course, there's Christine, the one who got away. Still, not even my lucky butt can have everything.</em></p>

      <p>He cuddled up closer. <em>Mmmm. So cozy. I hope this is a taste of things to come. Wouldn't it be great if I could sleep with Sis or Mom every night? Or both! The only problem is, I don't think we'd get much sleeping done.</em> He mentally chuckled.</p>

      <p>As if reading his mind, she said, "Big Weather Vane Brother, I'm so happy. Just so happy to be near you, lying beside you. I know that sometimes everything seems sex, sex, sex these days, but forget all that. Even without that, I'm just so happy you're my brother."</p>

      <p>"Little Sis, I love you so much."</p>

      <p>"I feel the same," Katherine replied. "I can really feel the love between us and our bond growing even closer. I can't tell you how much I love the cuddling last night. It made me feel like I'm one of your girlfriends."</p>

      <p>"You ARE one of my girlfriends."</p>

      <p>"You know what I mean. Let's just lay here and enjoy the togetherness."</p>

      <p>He didn't know what she meant, but he didn't press the issue.</p>

      <p>She sighed happily, and then mumbled to herself, "Yes! Mmmm. Brother. My true love."</p>

      <p>Alan was so tired that not even the sensation of Katherine lying there could keep him awake for long.</p>

      <p>The next thing he knew, he heard his alarm ringing. He automatically reached over to slap it shut, as he always did, and his hand did manage to hit the off button. But then he realized there was something on top of him, impeding his movement. He directed his attention downwards, just as his eyes opened up.</p>

      <p>His eyes went wide as he saw a very large lump under his covers and he felt incredible sensations coming from his stiff penis. A familiar tongue was working on the sensitive spot right below his cockhead. <em>I'd know that technique anywhere! She always goes straight for the jugular and keeps working that one spot! What did Aunt Suzy call it yesterday? Oh yeah, the frenulum. That feels great!</em></p>

      <p>He exclaimed, "Sis?!" But then he realized that he had to keep his voice down, so he repeated it in a whisper. "Sis!"</p>

      <p>Katherine giggled. She pulled her mouth off his cock, and pouted, "I'm hurt." She swirled her tongue around his cockhead.</p>

      <p>He rolled his eyes. "What now?"</p>

      <p>"That you'd wake up from the alarm clock but not my mouth, your fuck toy 'alarm clock.' I guess I'm going to have to resort to stiffer measures to get you to wake. Mmmm. Stiff." Her body began moving.</p>

      <p>"Uh-oh. I'm up already. Didn't you notice?"</p>

      <p>"It's possible, but I'll just have to make sure." She threw back the covers and exposed the glory of her tanned naked body to his eyes.</p>

      <p>He looked at her ravishing teenage body, and quipped, "It is a tough life, but someone's got to live it. What time is it?" He looked over at the alarm clock and saw it read six o'clock. "Six? Why so damned early?"</p>

      <p>Forced to talk, she resorted to jacking him off with both hands and licking his cockhead when she could. "Mom gets up way early. Do you realize how much time it takes a woman to get pretty in the morning? Sure, none of us use much make up, except for Suzanne, but there's all the anal lubing and butt flexing exercises we've got to do. Plus, I don't want to rush too much."</p>

      <p>He smiled, but then something she said puzzled him. "Butt flexing? What are you talking about?"</p>

      <p>"Oh, never you mind. Something we all learned from Xania recently. Though I have to say I'm upset with her."</p>

      <p>"Who?"</p>

      <p>"Mom. I know you call her your special alarm clock, but how often does she actually wake you up with a blowjob? Getting pretty is important so we can tempt you with our fuckable bodies and keep your fat cock stiff and throbbing all day long, but is it more important than waking up your cock properly? I don't think so! If she's unwilling to do her duty, I'm more than willing to wake you with my tongue and lips every morning!"</p>

      <p>"But, uh..." He was having a hard time thinking while his sister's hands slid up and down on his prick. "Um, I think she wants to save my hard-ons for breakfast time fun."</p>

      <p>"You need a wake up blowjob AND breakfast time fun. It's an outrage you're not woken up with a blowjob every day! You're the man of the house, as Mom never ceases to remind us. We are your fuck toys, here to serve you at all times, in every way. But don't worry about such cocksucking politics. Mom and I'll work it out. One of us will suck you awake tomorrow, don't you worry. Just enjoy your number one fuck toy." She began slurping up the side of his pole as she finished saying that.</p>

      <p>"So what do you and Mom talk about during your butt flexing, or whatever it is?"</p>

      <p>"Grrr!"</p>

      <p>"What?"</p>

      <p>"Every time I put my lips on your cock, you make me have to talk again." I'd totally punch you, except that I've mastered the art of licking and talking at the same time.</p>

      <p>She showed off her licking skills on his sweet spot before continuing. "But, in short, we've been chatting and getting up together for about a week. Mom usually does most of the talking. She usually goes on and on about what an extremely important day it is for you, sexually speaking, and how we need to do our best to make you cum a lot. She used to talk a lot about your six-times-a-day target, but now she's pretty much keen on getting you to cum as many times as you humanly can. Of course, she reminds me, and herself, that it's not just a matter of how many times you cum, but how long and satisfying each orgasmic session is."</p>

      <p>Reminding herself about the importance of giving his dick prolonged joy, she stopped talking for a minute and just lapped against his sweet spot, and jacked off the rest.</p>

      <p>Alan put his hands behind his head and relaxed. He figured they'd be here for a while.</p>

      <p>Finally, she continued, "She usually gives me dire warnings about the dangers of blue balls, chafing, and the sins of Onan. She always reminds me that, as family fuck toys, our role is to serve. Sometimes, we speculate who you're gonna fuck at school, or reminisce about some orgasmically amazing thing you did to one of us the day before."</p>

      <p>Her fingers rubbed and fondled as she went on, "It sounds a bit corny, and it gets annoying when she goes over her precious Big Tits Theory again and again, but all in all it's a lot of fun. It gets me psyched up to perform my fuck toy duties. Both of us get really hot, especially when we spend a lot of time lubing each other's asses up. So by the time you come downstairs for breakfast our pussies are usually already dripping, and we're hot for cock." She dropped her mouth back over his dick.</p>

      <p>"Jesus," Alan muttered.</p>

      <p>"What?"</p>

      <p>"Oh, nothing. It's just..."</p>

      <p>"Whah alreahy?" This time she was talking through her cocksucking and stroking, so she wasn't very clear.</p>

      <p>"It's just... I had no idea. That's really wild. I can't believe the extremes you two go to in order to please me. You really don't need to do all that."</p>

      <p>She sighed, because she was forced to pull off and talk again. "But I love you. Mom loves you. It makes us happy. Besides, it's way fun! I used to hate waking up, but now I practically leap out of bed. I've never been so content as I am being your fuck toy. I guess I'm just submissive that way."</p>

      <p>He pondered that, at least as much as he could, given that she kept on slathering his sweet spot with her busy tongue.</p>

      <p>As long as her head was up and she wasn't busy bobbing on him, she wanted to take the opportunity to get him more involved. One of her hands stopped her stroking long enough to pick up one of his hands and bring it to her chest. "Do I have to remind you what these things hanging off my rib cage are?" She quickly brought her hand back for double-pumping action on his stiff pole.</p>

      <p>He laughed. "No. But geez! Give me a second. My penis might have woken up already, but the rest of me takes longer."</p>

      <p>"Actually, Alan Junior was up long before you were. How could I sleep when your morning woody wanted to get going even before you woke up? He was insistently poking around my butt, trying to find my pussy."</p>

      <p>He laughed again. "Figures. He's been like that lately."</p>

      <p>"Did you have pleasant dreams? I hope you did, because I've been practicing my handjob and cocksucking technique for most of the last hour on your morning wood."</p>

      <p>"Now that you mention it, I was having the best erotic dream. But the reality is so much better."</p>

      <p>His thoughts drifted back as he tried to recall his dream in more detail. He'd been the sultan of an ancient kingdom. He had his harem gathered around him in his ornate throne room, all dressed in skimpy and usually transparent outfits. His dream harem consisted of Susan, Suzanne, Amy, Katherine, Glory, Brenda, Heather, Simone, Christine, Akami, Xania, Kim, Janice, and Joy. But there were others too, including some more hotties from school that he'd lusted after at one time or another, like Donna and the school principal Mrs. Napoleoni. But what really surprised him was there some famous women there as well, including Elle Macpherson, Petra Verkaik, and Elizabeth Hurley.</p>

      <p>He did a mental count and realized there were 22 women there in all. One thing that pleased him was that the famous women were no more beautiful than the others. In fact, in his opinion, Susan and Suzanne were the most physically impressive of them all (although Xania, Brenda, and Christine were very close).</p>

      <p>Generally, three or four of the gorgeous women were servicing him at any one time, while others were performing erotic dances right in front of him. Some were having sex in twos or threes or more with each other elsewhere in the room. The smell of incense hung heavy in the air. He found it exciting to watch Elizabeth Hurley and Suzanne rub their tremendous racks together, and was surprised and amused to see Britney Spears in there as well, in a sixty-nine with Heather. He didn't even consciously realize that pop star was on his fantasy list, and he felt a bit abashed about it.</p>

      <img id="glory116c" class="center" src="part42a/glory116c.jpg" title="glory116c" alt="Glory" />

      <p>But what took up most of his attention was the way Glory was dancing for him. He could hardly recognize her, with a shawl over her hair and a veil over much of her face. But she looked ravishing as she gyrated with the skills of a professional belly dancer, especially because her body was oiled up and all of her privates were exposed.</p>

      <p>He sighed in fond remembrance of the dream and thought, <em>Now, THAT is the life. No, wait. What am I talking about? My life is just about as perfect as that already! Seriously! Any more women in my life and it would be too much, even Liz Hurley.</em> He laughed inside and added, <em>Okay, I think I still have room for her!</em></p>

      <p><em>Still, I AM living the dream! Geez, just to think that she was sucking and stroking me even while I was dreaming all that!</em></p>

      <p>Katherine could see a big smile on his face and a far away look in his eyes, and somehow she could tell he wasn't just basking in the glorious sensations of her talented blowjob. She asked while still polishling his knob with her lips and tongue, "Wha ah you thinging abou?"</p>

      <p>He replied, "Oh, I'm just thinking what an amazing, beautiful, and all around wonderful sister I have."</p>

      <p>She mock-sighed and pulled her lips off his dick yet again. She pulled his hand massaging her breasts up to her mouth and kissed it. "Such a flatterer. If you keep it up, I'm just going to have to suck and fuck you all day long. Of course, that's my duty in any case, being your number one fuck toy and all."</p>

      <p>She let out another mock sigh. "But you're hopeless. I give up on trying to suck you right now, 'cos you're too much of a chatterbox. I have a better idea." She pulled his hand back into her mouth and sexily sucked on his fingers, one by one.</p>

      <p>He thought she was talking about the finger sucking and closed his eyes to enjoy the sensation.</p>

      <p>But that was just a feint. She straddled herself over his midsection and sat down on his erection before he could fully figure out what was going on.</p>

      <p>"Unh!" he grunted, as she slowly impaled herself on him. "Hey! I was kind of enjoying that blowjob. It was over before I even knew it was happening."</p>

      <p>She giggled. "I'm afraid you're just going to have to suffer though a sister fuck instead. Besides, my jaw and hands are tired. Remember, I was sucking you a long time before you even woke up." She was in a gentle and playful mood, and slowly raised and lowered her hips over him, while his mind was still playing catch up.</p>

      <p>Between that and the way she was slowly rising and falling on his dick, all Alan could think was, <em>Dang!</em> As much as he enjoyed blowjobs, he had to admit that fucking was slightly better. Katherine's pussy was hot and tight, although not nearly as tight as Amy's. The all-over friction blast felt incredible.</p>

      <p>She asked while she bounced on his cock, her tits flying about in a slow circular motion, "I know you love me and all, but what were you REALLY thinking about?"</p>

      <p>"Oh, just my dream. In it, I had a big harem and I was living the life of Riley, having nonstop sex with the most beautiful women in the world."</p>

      <p>She laughed. "Are you sure that was a dream, and not, say, yesterday?"</p>

      <p>He said, "That's what I was thinking too. Thus the big smile on my face. Everyone was all dressed up in sexy little harem outfits. Or I should say dressed down. It was totally great."</p>

      <p>"Ah."</p>

      <p>After some more bouncing, she asked, "Who was there?"</p>

      <p>He told her all the names.</p>

      <p>She laughed at hearing the likes of Brittany Spears. But her jealousy flared when she heard Christine was in his dream harem. Still, she was having such a great time getting fucked that she didn't let it bother her too much. Besides, she figured that if even Joy and Janice were in his dream, it would have been more surprising if Christine wasn't there.</p>

      <img id="kath119c" class="center" src="part42a/kath119c.jpg" title="kath119c" alt="Katherine" />

      <p>They continued quietly and slowly for a while, with all of Katherine's body bouncing up and down on him like a pogo stick, over and over. The pleasure seemed endless.</p>

      <p>He was too horny to pace himself and take occasional breaks like he usually did. He impaled her with increased energy and aggression.</p>

      <p>Soon, he flooded her pussy with his cum while she orgasmed on top of him, delightfully clenching her pussy around his cock with every orgasmic tremor that ran through her.</p>

      <p>Katherine sneaked back to her room very satisfied. Her thighs dripped with cum. She'd loved merely sleeping with her brother almost as much as fucking him, and eagerly hoped it would happen again, and not just for part of the night.</p>

      <p>Alan, though, was exhausted. He changed his sheets to avoid getting caught when his mother did laundry later, and then reset his alarm clock and went back to sleep. He figured he'd wake up a little later than usual and rush through his morning routine.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_2">CHAPTER 2</h2>

      <p>The next thing Alan knew, he was waking, but not because of an alarm clock. He felt a mouth on his dick again. His first instinct was to gently gibe Katherine for her recklessness in getting caught by Susan, until he realized that the mouth in question actually was his mother's. There was a difference in the smell (Susan favored apricot flavored shampoo recently), the way the long hair brushed across his legs, and the blowjob technique itself. Lately Susan had become more "professional" and technically accomplished, no doubt due to the advice Suzanne and Xania had given her.</p>

      <p>He recognized her current move as something she liked to call "The Pole Dance." She enjoyed cocksucking so much that she gave creative names to just about every little technique she knew, and she loved to refer to them by name. In this one, she had his entire knob in her mouth and slumped up and down on it in corkscrew fashion, while her tongue danced all over it inside her mouth. She did a lot of corkscrew moves, but what made this unique was the "dancing" of her tongue. It flickered against his sweet spot so quickly that it was nearly a blur.</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>Wow, TWO alarm clock blowjobs in one morning. Too cool for school. I really am getting pampered beyond all reason. This is ridiculous. I'll give them, hmmm, a couple of years to stop.</em> He chuckled silently.</p>

      <p>She didn't realize he was awake until he opened his eyes, and said, "Hmmm. It seems someone let a pole dancer into the room. Or is it Playboy's Miss December? I swear that was you."</p>

      <p>She giggled. "Good morning, Son! I would say rise and shine, but you clearly have the 'rise' part taken care of already." She kissed his cock affectionately all over. "I hope you don't mind me coming in here, but I just couldn't wait to taste your manhood. I just love morning wood! Mmmm. And the smell of hard son-cock. It positively reeks of sex in here this morning! MMMM!" She engulfed his cockhead again.</p>

      <img id="susan339c" class="center" src="part42a/susan339c.jpg" title="susan339c" alt="Susan" />

      <p>He laughed inwardly. <em>Like mother, like daughter.</em></p>

      <p>But he didn't fail to realize that his mother was now sucking his cock only a short time after it had been inside his sister's pussy. <em>If she only knew the reason for the strong sex smell! It's a good thing Sis gave my dick a very thorough tongue cleaning after we'd finished, or I'm sure Mom would have suspected something.</em></p>

      <p>He quickly changed the subject to be on the safe side and distract her from thinking further about sex smells. "You know, Mom, we should install a real pole in the living room for some real pole dancing."</p>

      <p>"What, you want your Mommy to get naked and dance around like a slutty, big-titted whore in the living room just for your amusement? What a great idea!"</p>

      <p>They both laughed. But he chided her, "Remember what I said about calling yourself a whore."</p>

      <p>She smiled as she licked. "That's right. I'm only a slut for my son!" That made her very happy.</p>

      <p>Thinking about his pole-dancing commment some more, she added, "But we don't need another big pole in this house when we've got this one between your legs. On, and by the way, I was hoping to wake you up with this. It's a new one."</p>

      <p>She slipped his cockhead into her mouth again and took him as far as she could go, which was just over a third of his whole erection. Then, with her lips firmly sealed all around and sucking up and down, her tongue started a frantic dance inside her mouth, as if she was trying to imitate the blur of a hummingbird's wings. The tip of her wildly flapping tongue was right on the side of his shaft and her tongue covered most of one side with its crazy motions while her lips kept sliding up and down.</p>

      <p>It was similar to her "Pole Dance" technique, but different because there was a lot more suction and sliding of lips. It actually was a very difficult technique to do, and she was proud of herself for accomplishing it for the first time.</p>

      <p>After that elicited some pleasant grunts, she popped off and said, "You like? I just thought that up last night as I was going to sleep. I call it the 'Alarm Cock' 'cos it's sure to get your attention."</p>

      <p>They both laughed as she went down on him again.</p>

      <p>"That was great! Inventive. Mom, I seriously think you're going to become the Leonardo da Vinci of cocksuckers."</p>

      <p>"Thanths! How bou thith?"</p>

      <p>"Ack!" Her switch to "The Tongue Bath and Tooth Scrape" technique took him by surprise. "Whoa! Nice. So what's the occasion for the special wake up call?"</p>

      <p>She popped off his pole again. "Reason? No reason. Your 'special alarm clock' should try to wake you up like this every morning, but usually I'm too busy getting ready myself. But today I was thinking we could get this out of the way early so you could focus on your upcoming tests. Well, either that, or I could blow you some more during breakfast." She smiled and winked at him.</p>

      <p>But then she got back to serious business. "Now stop making your mommy talk when she's busy sucking cock."</p>

      <p>"Ugh! Mom, why did you have to remind me of the tests? Talk about a turn-off! Dang. What a downer." He frowned as he remembered everything he'd have to do in school.</p>

      <p>But he also thought, <em>It's as if she could hear Sis talking earlier, saying that Mom didn't give me a good morning cocksucking nearly often enough. I wonder if Mom did hear, or if this is spontaneous? But if she heard, then she would have known we fucked too, and she's giving no sign of that. Probably they talk about this kind of stuff when they're doing their "anal flexing," whatever the heck that is.</em></p>

      <p>Susan resumed an intermittent combination of licking, talking, and cock kissing. His dick was just as stiff as ever, but she seemed overly concerned by his casual comment about tests being a turn-off. "Oh dear. If there's one thing I dread happening, it's turning you off." She cupped her hands in front of her mouth and yelled, "KATHERINE! ANGEL?"</p>

      <p>Katherine was getting ready in her room. She came hustling over to Alan's room immediately, still dressed in a nightgown. She smiled widely at what had obviously been going on. "Wow, Mom! You go, girl!"</p>

      <p>Alan stood and he shared a brief good morning French kiss with his sister.</p>

      <p>Susan waited impatiently, cocksucking air, pretending that she simply couldn't stop her mouth from sucking.</p>

      <p>As soon the kissing ended, Susan, back to happily stroking and licking Alan's erection, said to her daughter, "Angel dear, Tiger here was just saying that he was in danger of going flaccid. I think you'll agree there can be no bigger disaster in this house. I might be forced to get all lesbian on you to make sure that doesn't happen." She opened her mouth quite wide and plunged it down over his bulbous head as far as she could go once she'd finished talking.</p>

      <p>Katherine put her hands up to her large "O" shaped mouth, as if she was doing her best Macaulay Culkin "Home Alone" impression. "Oh no! Why, we'll both have to get totally dyke-y! It pains me to say this, Mom, but I'll probably have to lick your muff while you keep sucking on him, and then we'll be forced to suck him off together!"</p>

      <p>Alan laughed and said sarcastically, "Forgive me for bringing such suffering upon this house."</p>

      <p>Everyone laughed, even Susan with her oral cavity totally stuffed with cock-meat.</p>

      <p>He commented, "You two sure have fun with sex, don't you?"</p>

      <p>Susan managed an enthusiastic "Mmmm hmmm!" while she continued to suck him.</p>

      <img id="kathsusan002c" class="center" src="part42a/kathsusan002c.jpg" title="kathsusan002c" alt="KatherineSusan" />

      <p>But Katherine protested, "I don't know what you're talking about, Big Snow Shovel Brother! Suffering, I tells ya! This is suffering. Pure torture!" Then her giggles quieted down as she got in position to lick her mother's pussy.</p>

      <p>Alan stood near the foot of his bed and watched Susan on all fours sucking him while Katherine licked her mother's ass further on down the bed.</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>Mom positively lives for sex now. There's never been a better time than today for her to get fucked in the hole that most needs fucking! She's so ripe! I just hope we'll do it this afternoon and not have to wait any more.</em></p>

      <p>Susan was thinking, <em>My pussy... tingling! Angel's lips... fantastic! Ass is... quivering! My tits... swaying free! My lips... sucking! Tongue... fellating! Somebody kill me now 'cos this is how I want to die! I'm in heaven already! My children love me!</em></p>

      <p>They continued like that for a couple of minutes until Katherine's rim job made Susan cum.</p>

      <p>At that time, Susan had her lips as far down Alan's dick as she could get them, given that she had yet to master the art of deep throating.</p>

      <p>Alan could actually feel and hear her scream around his hard-on as the waves of orgasmic ecstasy passed through her.</p>

      <p>But she still had lots of energy. In fact, she hopped off the bed and sat on her heels next to her son. She immediately squeezed his iron-hard pole between her soft tits, and started a wonderful titfuck. Lubrication was not a worry since his dick was so wet already with pre-cum and saliva, and beads of sweat were all over her chest.</p>

      <p>She said to Katherine, who was resting on the bed, "This is no time for lollygagging, Angel. You need to go to the bathroom and rinse your mouth out, because your tongue is needed over here. It's a scientific fact that a superior cock like Tiger's has trouble cumming from just one pair of lips at a time."</p>

      <p>Alan had no idea where she'd come up with that "scientific fact" but he wasn't about to question the point.</p>

      <p>Katherine stood up and scurried to get clean.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_3">CHAPTER 3</h2>

      <p>Susan wasn't nearly as practiced with titfucking as she was with cocksucking, but she was already starting to develop various techniques for that as well. She liked it a lot when her son used her rack as a pussy and thrust back and forth into it, but now he was just standing still and letting her do all the work. She had some different strategies to deal with such occasions. Right now, she was alternately rubbing her tits up and down, meaning when one stroked up, the other stroked down.</p>

      <p>She said, "Tiger, the reason I'm switching to titfucking is so we can talk. I have some bad news. This morning, I still have my, well, my flow. You know what that means."</p>

      <p>"Oh drat! That sucks."</p>

      <p>"I know, I know! You're telling me! Last night I could hardly get to sleep. All I could think about is how you'll be taking complete possession of your mommy. How you'll be filling me, drilling me, flooding me with sperm! You know, I used to hold back from even thinking about you nailing my cunt, even though I knew it was inevitable, deep down. It doesn't really matter how immoral it is, a real man like you, he takes what he wants!"</p>

      <p>"That's not true," Alan protested while watching her boobs rise up and down on either side of his pole. His hands kneading Susan's ass and he giving her ass cheeks a good workout in time to her titfucking rhythm.</p>

      <p>"It is!" she protested back. "Big-titted vixens just have no defense, no prayer of resisting your well-hung cock. You could have taken my cunt weeks ago and made me your slave! But you were just so nice. I dare say too nice, even though I love you for it."</p>

      <p>Katherine had walked back into the room since cleaning her mouth and hands had only taken a minute. Before Alan could respond to Susan's comments, Susan asked, "Angel, what do you think? Don't you agree that Tiger turning us into his personal fuck toys is just the way of the world? How could it be any other way?" She deliberately used the term 'fuck toy,' knowing how much her daughter liked that.</p>

      <p>Katherine tried to sound like the voice of reason instead of imitating Susan's hyperactive, over the top style. "She's got a point, Bro," she said calmly while kneeling down next to her mother. "Um, can I get in on the action, here?"</p>

      <p>"Sure thing, Angel. Tiger, why don't you lie down so she can sit on your face." She half joked, "We don't need to hear your modest protests anyway. Listen to two wise women who know what they're talking about."</p>

      <p>As Alan repositioned himself, Katherine continued, "Brother, sure, the six-times-a-day diagnosis was so fitting for you, and really opened things up. But I was in love with you big time even before then. So was Aunt Suzy. So was Amy. Aunt Suzy would have had her way with you in any case, because what she wants, she gets. And as we can see, she's not at all averse to sharing you; in fact, she encourages it. Plus, we've seen that Amy can be a lot trickier than we all realized. Once you started getting into sex, it was only inevitable that you'd be nailing both of them and a few girls at school, besides."</p>

      <img id="kathsusan036c" class="center" src="part42a/kathsusan036c.jpg" title="kathsusan036c" alt="KatherineSusan" />

      <p>Alan wanted to protest that, but his mouth was full of his sister's pussy. Susan was hanging over him, still giving him a good titfuck while licking his cockhead whenever it came close to her mouth.</p>

      <p>Katherine went on, "Naturally, you'd be slippin' the sausage with the Pestridge gals all over this house, due to the problems with Eric and Brad next door. I would have given in pretty quickly, I'm sure. I was primed to go. So Mom would be the only hold out, and I admit that would have taken longer. But come on! Look at her! She's so submissive and downright hot, and you're so dominant and handsome, it was just a matter of time before you added her to your harem. So the bottom line is, it is only natural that a man like you takes possession of all of us."</p>

      <p>Susan wildly agreed with that. "Angel! That is SO damn brilliant! That makes me feel so much better to know I wasn't almost doomed to a lonely, sexless life chained to a loveless marriage with a gay man. What a relief! I should have known that it wasn't just a fluke and that my son would come to own me and take control of my busty body, no matter what! Oh God!"</p>

      <p>Trembling with joy, she dove down onto her son's shaft, taking it so far down that she choked and gagged for a few seconds. She was going all out on it now.</p>

      <p>Alan strongly disagreed with Katherine's assessment; he felt it was revisionist history. He suspected that it was probably true that he would have gotten involved with Suzanne eventually, but things would have ended there. No way would Suzanne have allowed him to get involved with Amy except for all the strange things that had happened. In fact, she still had issues with Amy's sexuality now. <em>Probably I'd have ended up with Aunt Suzy. If she wanted me, I was hers for the taking. My God! What if she and I got married? That could have happened; it might even have been likely. Well, that certainly would have been a pretty cool fate; she's an amazing woman, and as smart as she is beautiful. God knows I totally love her. But I prefer having her AND the rest of my harem too!</em></p>

      <p>However, he had to stop thinking because Susan was staging an all-out assault on his dick, using lips, tongues, two hands, and every trick she knew. Plus Katherine was grinding her dripping pussy down into his mouth and it took a certain amount of concentration to deal with tonguing it properly.</p>

      <p>As the only one with a free mouth at the moment, Katherine kept talking too. "Big Racquetball Racquet Brother, I know what you're thinking. 'No way! I was a virgin until two months ago! Blah blah blah.' But you're wrong. You have no idea how much I wanted you before this all began, for starters. Anyways, it's a moot point. You're cock of the walk now. You've turned me into one of your fuck toys and I totally love it! And I'm so happy for Mom, too. I can't wait until you have the two of us in a fuck sandwich, taking turns slipping in and out of our pussies!"</p>

      <p>"Mppffh!" Susan shrieked with delight upon hearing that, even though her mouth was stuffed full with cock again.</p>

      <p>As she pumped her lips up and down his boner, she thought, <em>Oh my God, I just have to swallow his load right now, I just HAVE to! I need his spunk in my tummy like I need air to breathe! Cum, dammit, cum!</em> Her tongue flicked at his sweet spot, and her suction created an airtight seal, but even that wasn't enough. <em>Cum, Son! Cum, cum, cum! What more can I possibly do?! Why won't this gorgeous fuck-meat cum already?!</em></p>

      <p>She panted excitedly, "Quick, Angel, we have an emergency! It's like I feared; we need two cocksucking tongues at the very least!"</p>

      <p>Actually, Alan was right on the verge of cumming, but once again he felt no burning need to correct his mother on her excellent suggestion.</p>

      <p>Katherine was greatly enjoying what Alan was doing to her pussy, but she got right up and repositioned herself to the side of his reclining body so she could get a piece of the action. She squealed happily, "Mom, let's share our mouths with him just like we'll be sharing our cunts!"</p>

      <p>That set Susan off on another cocksucking frenzy, but she was mindful enough to work her way up one side with her flickering tongue and hungry lips so her daughter could do the same on the other side.</p>

      <p>Once both of them were going at it full bore, there was no way for Alan to hold out, no matter what tricks he used. He was right on the verge as it was, anyway. However, using his great self-control, he suddenly shouted, "Break! Strategic break!"</p>

      <p>The two relentlessly horny women pretended they didn't hear him, so he was forced to completely disenage.</p>

      <p>They both groaned and moaned in frustration. "Come on, Son!" Susan cried. "You can't be serious!" Katherine complained.</p>

      <p>He panted, "Just a sec." After some moments, he started again, "You see..." But he was still too winded. He had to wait nearly a minute before he could continue. "You see, it's not every day that I get a double blowjob. I absolutely LOVE these! So I want to treasure each and every one. The way things were going, I wouldn't have lasted even a minute."</p>

      <p>Susan and Katherine looked at each other like they'd just uncovered some sort of scandal.</p>

      <p>Katherine was the first to ask the obvious question, but Susan would have asked it too. "Why is he NOT enjoying a double blowjob every day? That just seems wrong to me."</p>

      <p>Susan emphatically agreed. "Me too! It IS wrong!" She looked up at Alan. "I'm sorry, Son. I had no idea. You poor thing! Take all the time you want to rest and recover. Then Angel and I will give you a niiiiice, looooong tongue bath."</p>

      <p>He shook his head in disbelief. <em>Man! Life is GOOD!</em></p>

      <p>After a few more minutes, he announced he was ready for more action.</p>

      <p>Susan and Katherine had been talking in urgent whispers while they waited for him. Once they resumed pleasuring his cock, it became apparent that they had been talking cocksucking sharing "strategy." They both took things slowly to prolong his pleasure, and they worked as one to keep him highly stimulated.</p>

      <p>For a good ten minutes, they couldn't have been more cooperative with each other, or better at keeping him riding an endless peak of pure ecstasy. As usual, the focus was his sweet spot, and it seemed that most of the time there were either two tongues lapping on it or tight lips sliding up and down it. There was an endless blur of stroking fingers on his balls and lower shaft too. He soon lost track of who was doing what to him, and he just reveled in the non-stop joy.</p>

      <p>It seemed as if everything was in slow motion, and that helped him "endure" all the stimuation. But it felt so good that not even he could last forever. The other two seemed to have forgotten about the need to get ready for school. But he was aware of the time pressure, and so he finally decided to stop fighting it, and quit clenching his PC muscle.</p>

      <p>The funny thing was, once he started to blow, Susan immediately stopping being so sharing with Katherine. She had no control over the matter because her mouth simply took control of her son's cockhead, swallowing it whole and going deeper and deeper down, impaling her face on his meaty pole. Her brain could lament the greediness, but her mouth refused to listen to any arguments. She needed his cum like she needed air to breathe!</p>

      <p>The first of his ropes shot straight down her throat, but she couldn't really taste that, so she pulled up enough for him to paint the back of her mouth instead. She tried to keep as much as possible in her mouth to savor.</p>

      <p>By the time he was done, Susan was already beginning to feel bad about her greediness. She said, "Sorry, Angel, I know I'm a cock hog. I can't help myself sometimes. I'm awful! But let me make it up to you. I've got almost all of his cum in my mouth still, let me snowball it to you."</p>

      <p>"Well, if you put it that way, I'm not so upset," Katherine replied with a giggle.</p>

      <p>Alan continued to lie on the floor while his mother and sister embraced and kissed right above him. <em>Man! I didn't even know my mom knew the word 'snowball.' Hell, I didn't even know the word, though I can guess what it means from what they're doing. Must be a term Aunt Suzy taught her.</em></p>

      <p>He lay there and enjoyed the sexy scene for a couple of minutes, until he thought, <em>Oh shit! School! Oh yeah. I actually have to get up and go to school?! That sucks! Good thing Sis had us start on the sex fun early, but how many hours sleep did I get last night? Three? Man, I'm gonna be so screwed later 'cos when I don't get my sleep I'm a basket case.</em></p>

      <p><em>Sigh. I wish I could just stay in bed all day with a big harem, just like in my dream... Hell, who am I kidding, I HAVE a harem! Why do I keep denying that? How much more clear do Mom and Sis at least have to make it that they completely adore the idea? So what if it's not a politically correct term? I need to fully embrace my wonderful life. Maybe it's time I do something to formalize the weird dynamic we've got going. Maybe like a club or a ritual or something. No, it's way more than a club, that's all wrong. A ritual, that's what we need.</em></p>

      <p><em>But I'll have to think about that later. Right now, I've got to get ready for school.</em></p>

      <p>He started to get up.</p>

      <p>"Wait! Where are you going?" Susan asked. "I haven't licked your cock and balls clean yet."</p>

      <p>"Mom, we're in kind of a hurry to get to school. Maybe we should skip that this one time."</p>

      <p>"Pshaw! These kinds of traditions are very important. I just wouldn't be a good loving mommy if I don't lick you completely clean. Please let me do this."</p>

      <p>He was a bit chagrined, but he closed his eyes and let her go at it. Since time was short, Susan agreed to let Katherine help with the cleaning.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_4">CHAPTER 4</h2>

      <p>The rest of the morning at home was uneventful for everyone because there was no time left but to scarf down a quick breakfast, take a shower, and rush off to school. About the only sexy things were the prolonged goodbye kisses Alan and Katherine gave their mother.</p>

      <p>That made Alan thoughtful. As he biked to school, he thought, <em>This is not just one wild week, or one wild month. This is how it's going to be forever! I'm never going to live separate from Mom and Sis if I can help it. Hell, twenty years from now, Mom'll probably still be cooking the two of us breakfast in her erotic apron and then blowing me through breakfast before necking and rubbing her tits all over my chest as I head out the door to work. Why the hell not? I know some people might find it odd to live with their moms, but they wouldn't think that if she was a perfect ten totally submissive bombshell fuck toy!</em></p>

      <p><em>Hell, and knowing her, she'll probably look even better then than she does now! Man, "my future's so bright I gotta wear shades," that's all I can say. I just need to make it through today, and then the hiking trip, and soon I'll be balls-deep in Mom's cunt! Not just once or twice, but every day, forever! How cool is that?!</em></p>

      <p>He resolved to seriously focus on his classes for at least a few hours. He would have liked to repeat his remote vibrator control fun with Glory, but he knew that would ruin his concentration, and furthermore she was too sore to take another day so quickly. He had a triple whammy of tests in his first, second, and third periods, so he hunkered down and avoided distractions.</p>

      <p>Normally, he would have been quite nervous seeing Christine for the first time since he'd passionately necked with her at the pub the night before. But he made it to his first period class with no time to spare, so all he could really do was smile and say "Hi" as he took his front-row seat next to hers. She seemed to look and act perfectly normal, which made things easier.</p>

      <p>He found himself grateful that they had tests for their first two classes, because it forced them to focus on test taking. They walked together between classes, talking as they went, but by then they were both so deeply in test-taking mode that it was easy for them to act as if the events of the previous evening had never occurred.</p>

      <p>Alan's two tests came and went. He felt pretty good about how he'd done. As he waited at the end of his second period class, he thought, <em>Finally! That monkey is off my back. I've got one test left in fifth period, but I know I'll cruise through that one. Heather came through with the illegally authored essay, and it was a good one too. From now on, I'm going to do better so I never have to do that kind of cheating again. Not only is it wrong, but doing wrong leaves me vulnerable to blackmail. Especially from Heather. Despite our good meeting yesterday, I still don't trust her farther than I can throw her. Hell, I don't trust her farther than the eight inches I can fuck her.</em></p>

      <p><em>But those worries are for another day. I made it through a tough week and now I get my rewards! First off, I'm gonna fuck Glory silly for lunch. We've never done that Princess Leia role-play she wants to do. I saw that she still has that costume buried in her supply closet, so we can do that one. Sean's such a big Star Wars fan; I wonder what he'd think if he was a fly on the wall for that one.</em></p>

      <p><em>Speaking of which, with these tests basically out of the way, I have to find Sean again and get a progress report on his second Kim fuck. And I wanna hear Kim's side of it, too. Probably I should get her take first. I hope he did well, because the Xania thing is all arranged for him and right around the corner. I wonder what she'll think when he shows up there with his car all filled with camping gear. I hope the cover story of him being a guest on my scouting trip holds with his parents. It should. The call from my mom to his mom should prevent any doubts, I should think.</em></p>

      <p><em>And then there's the hiking trip. I've been so focused on everything else that I've practically forgotten about that. But it should be a good break for me, both mentally and physically. A chance to give my mind and my penis big vacations. Forty-eight straight hours without cumming. That'll be strange.</em></p>

      <p><em>But there's so much to do beforehand! Not only finish packing, but I've got all kinds of unresolved issues to deal with, most of which hopefully involve more sex, heh-heh. I might as well go out in style and completely drain my balls before I go. I think I can afford another fuck with Heather as final payback for the "help" with the essay. Then there's an appointment with Akami in the afternoon, which is certainly going to have more sex in it. Oh. Wait. Heather'll be at the football game cheerleading after school. Well that's one less fuck for me, for good or for bad. Probably for good - I'm only human.</em></p>

      <p><em>And then there's the one really huge question. Is Mom's period over so I can finally fuck her? Mom did say she's still "on the rag," but that could change by the afternoon. All hope is not lost that today could be the big day.</em></p>

      <p><em>If worse comes to worst, we'll have to wait until after the hiking trip. But that might actually be better, if we can both hold out until then. We could make a really big production out of it, and I'll be so backed up with cum I'll be able to fuck her ten times in one day! Okay, maybe not, but a hell of a lot of times.</em> He chuckled to himself.</p>

      <p><em>So sweet! I'm getting a boner just thinking about it. But in any case, she's going to want to play around before I go. I can at least console myself with that. A titfuck? An assfuck? Or the tried and true blowjob? Another double blowjob? Dang, I love those! So many good possibilities.</em></p>

      <p><em>This is gonna be a very sexually busy afternoon. All I know is, as soon as that final school bell rings, I'm going to have as many fucks as my body can stand until the van comes to take me away. It's going to be glorious. Talk about "Thank God It's Friday!" Sweetness!</em></p>

      <p>Alan had been carrying on so much about how his tests and the 20 page essay were bothering him, that a number of people knew when his academic day was finished, for all practical purposes. So when he walked out of his second-period class, Amy and Katherine were there, dressed in the skimpy red cheerleader uniforms they wore every Friday, ready to meet him with hugs and kisses (a chaste kiss on the cheek from Katherine, and a wet, lingering kiss on the lips from Amy). The two girls had finished their own tests, so the three of them gave each other high fives.</p>

      <p>But then Katherine suddenly said in a nervous voice, "We've gotta go," and the two girls rushed off without even goodbye hugs.</p>

      <p>Alan thought that was strange, as the five minute break period had just begun. But then he looked around and saw Heather coming his way, like a shark swimming through packs of helpless fish. She too was dressed in her cheerleader uniform. She had a serious and determined look on her face - which made Alan realize why Katherine and Amy had departed so suddenly. It seemed like Heather was coming his way to punch him in the face.</p>

      <p>However, when she got close, she smiled at him and said, "Hi! You said you had your two tough tests to start the day, so I figure you must be through the worst of it. How'd you do?"</p>

      <p>Alan was a bit taken aback by her casual, friendly question, especially since it contrasted dramatically with the searing look in her eyes. He replied, "Okay. I'm glad it's all over. I still have one more test later, but that one should be okay."</p>

      <img id="heather040c" class="center" src="part42a/heather040c.jpg" title="heather040c" alt="Heather" />

      <p>He hadn't gone more than a few feet from the door of his third period class, and he stood just out of the path of those wanting to exit or enter that room. Suddenly Heather grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him a few feet down the hall and pressed him up against the wall. He found himself positioned with his face only about a foot away from hers, and her legs on either side of his. It was the perfect position if they wanted to stand and neck against the hallway lockers, but that wasn't what Heather wanted to do.</p>

      <p>With Alan still playing catch-up, Heather grabbed one of his hands and drew it to her ass. As she did this, she said in a low and quiet voice, "Alan, thinking about our meeting yesterday makes me really HOT! It's all I can think about. I want you, no, NEED you, in my butt! Time is short and we all know what kind of day Friday is, so don't waste time!"</p>

      <p>He didn't know what she meant when she said "we all know what kind of day Friday is," but then he reviewed his memory of their meeting and recalled his "Groping Naked Heather Day" fantasy. He'd described how dozens and dozens of strange hands would grope her all day long every Friday as she'd only wear painted on panties, and possibly even just a painted on top as well. Then the feeling of her skin on his hand made him realize that she in fact wasn't wearing any panties. He thought, <em>Wow! She's doing the painted on panties thing! For real? Really?!</em></p>

      <p>She was doing the "painted on panties thing," but she was so excited about what Alan had told her the day before that even that didn't go far enough for her. She wasn't wearing panties, but hadn't had her crotch painted black yet either, as she planned to do that during sixth period cheerleading practice. The feeling of nudity not even covered by paint and the thrill of getting caught had her so aroused that she'd been practically glowing all morning.</p>

      <p>He looked around. There were kids milling about all over the place, and Heather was practically treated like a rock star at school, so people were always looking her way. It was remarkable no one had noticed where his hand was, mostly because it was covered by her cheerleader skirt, and they were standing close. He said, "Not here; this is nuts! Let's go around the corner, at least."</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_5">CHAPTER 5</h2>

      <p>Heather let out a frustrated grunt and then practically carried Alan around the corner. She eagerly assumed the same position as before.</p>

      <p>Touching Heather's privates in the school hall was still pretty crazy, even in their new location, but Alan couldn't resist. It only took him a couple of seconds from the time she pulled his hand up into her ass crack until he figured out what she wanted him to do. He began rubbing his hand over the inner slopes of her ass cheeks, and poked around the entry to her anus. The ecstatic and practically orgasmic facial expression right in front of his nose told him that he was doing the right thing. He was too frazzled to notice the difference in texture between painted and unpainted skin. In any case, he would never even have considered the possibility that she would have deliberately forgone even the minimal protection of painted panties underneath her short skirt.</p>

      <p>He looked to the right and left and wondered how the two of them would look to other people walking down the hall. Going around the corner had moved them from a crowded hall to a less crowed hall, but it wasn't deserted. He saw some girls walking by, staring in wide-eyed wonder. But to his relief, he saw they were staring at his face and Heather's face. The faces were so close that it looked like they were about to kiss. He figured they wouldn't have even considered the possibility that he'd have his hand all over Heather's ass under her skirt.</p>

      <p>However, he knew that Heather had such a fantastic ass that the next boys to walk by would probably be staring at it in any case. So he embraced her with his free hand and pulled her up so at least their activity would be less obvious. Then he switched to fingering her pussy from the front side. That would be a lot harder to notice, especially with their bodies closer together.</p>

      <img id="heather123c" class="center" src="part42a/heather123c.jpg" title="heather123c" alt="Heather" />

      <p>Heather was hoping to blindside Alan and so overwhelm him with sexuality and danger that she'd be able to assert control over their relationship. But right now she was the one feeling completely overwhelmed. She couldn't help but think back to the fantasies he'd put in her head of things like "Naked Heather Day" or wearing no clothes to school except painted on ones. Suddenly, she was filled with the naughty thought of Alan fucking her ass right then and there. She imagined herself wearing nothing but her cheerleader skirt and being lifted up into the air and held there by nothing but a wildly oversized version of Alan's erection.</p>

      <p>That turned her on so much she could barely contain herself. She even had trouble breathing. "Oh Alan!" she purred. "I can't believe what you do to me!"</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>I don't even want to be doing this. How do I get out of this? I can't seem to pull my hand away. What's wrong with me? Am I suicidal? What if some of the football players see me? Just standing this close to Heather would earn me a serious ass whooping.</em></p>

      <p>He took another look past Heather. To his surprise, he saw Heather's friend Simone standing less than ten feet away. A couple of her and Heather's mutual friends were standing with her, apparently all in on whatever Heather was up to, and enjoying the groping scene. Simone was positioned in the best spot to see what he was doing with his hand, and in so doing she and her friends had blocked off that view from anyone on his right side, no doubt deliberately. The left side was still wide open, and unfortunately they were at the corner of an L-bend in the hallway, so a big potential remained for people to see from that side.</p>

      <p>He motioned to Simone with his head, and nodded in the direction of the exposed side. She got his non-verbal message and moved to the other side of him and Heather. She stood quite close to Heather, effectively blocking the view from that side too.</p>

      <p>That was a big relief for Alan, but he still didn't like the situation. He whispered (even as his hand continued to explore her pussy lips), "Heather, this is dangerous!"</p>

      <p>She huskily replied, "I know!" But to her, that was a really good thing.</p>

      <p>The memory of being pushed and shoved by big football players in the hallway was at the forefront of his mind. He imagined what they'd do if they saw him like this, especially Rock, Heather's former boyfriend. He had a vision of being repeatedly punched and kicked by a crowd of big bullies, and then having his broken and bloody body thrown out a window into a trash dumpster. He whispered in a shaky voice, "The football players!" His heart pounded like a hammer.</p>

      <p>She breathily whispered back, "I'll take care of them! Remember what you're having me do? Believe me, they won't bother you anymore. Though I'll hate every minute of it, because you're so right about them. They're just jealous because they're a bunch of tiny-dicked losers who don't know how to fuck."</p>

      <p>Alan felt his hand wander between Heather's legs until it was back on her ass again. He was rather amazed that his hand would fondle Heather's ass even as he knew the act was ridiculously dangerous. He didn't have the willpower to stop, and it was like his hand wasn't being controlled by his brain. But at least he managed to quickly switch positions with Heather, so that she was now up against the lockers and his back faced the open hallway. He figured that was safer, though still far from completely safe, especially with the way Heather was breathing heavily now.</p>

      <p>The skirt and the wall covered up what his fingers were actually doing to her bare pussy and ass, but there couldn't be an innocent explanation if anyone noticed the general location of his hand. He couldn't move his hand much while Heather's body weight pressed it against the wall, but he managed to wiggle it around enough to keep Heather happy.</p>

      <p>He looked again at Simone, and saw her lick her lips ostentatiously at him.</p>

      <p>With a mischievous twinkle in her eye, Simone said, "Hi Alan. Did you lose something? I'm thinking you must have lost something around Heather's ass, because you sure are giving it a good search." She snickered.</p>

      <p>He turned back to Heather. Somehow, seeing Simone lick like that made him much more scared, as if it was possible for an orgy to break out in the hallway at any moment. He consoled himself that at least Simone was keeping her voice way down low so even the other girls standing near couldn't hear.</p>

      <p>Despite everything, his wiggling hand grew a little more adventurous, momentarily exploring her pussy lips.</p>

      <p>Simone was watching his every move and she said, "Smart guy! You obviously need to conduct a full cavity search." She giggled.</p>

      <p>Heather ignored that. She'd been planning to get a revenge of sorts for the way Alan had treated her the day before. She thought it was time to remind him who was really in charge of their relationship. At first she was too excited, but now she steeled her nerves and asked Alan, "Are you a 'fraidy cat? That's surprising, coming from you. I was going to jack you off, but you're obviously not in the mood." Even as she said this, she grasped his throbbing bulge through his pants.</p>

      <p>"What?! Right here in the hallway?!"</p>

      <p>She laughed at him, as if he was soft in the head to have a problem with that. "Where else? But time is short. We've only got a minute or two. I'll let you go as soon as you give me an orgasm." She figured she could control any man through his dick, and he'd soon be putty in her hands, ready to follow her agenda if she let him cum.</p>

      <img id="heather041c" class="center" src="part42a/heather041c.jpg" title="heather041c" alt="Heather" />

      <p>Alan felt very uncomfortable, because now Heather was in control and he was the one mentally knocked off balance. Not only was the situation embarrassing, but he knew it was also dangerous to let Heather think she could ever have the upper hand with him, like she did now. So, despite the danger, he quickly licked his long middle finger to get it lubed up, and then he stuck it up her asshole. He'd been reluctant to go that far, but he consoled himself that at least no one would imagine she wasn't actually wearing panties, and so probably not even Simone with her extremely close view could tell what his fingers were actually doing.</p>

      <p>Heather gasped, and she immediately appeared to wilt. The aggressive and practically triumphant look on her face disappeared and her whole body slumped down a couple of inches. Her ass was her weakness.</p>

      <p>He didn't realize that she hadn't even painted on any panties and that her new position caused her ass to stick out and her cheerleader skirt to rise up. He was so into the moment that he didn't hear Simone and the other girls gasp as most of Heather's bare ass came into view.</p>

      <p>He pushed his sudden advantage, and whispered, "Who's the bitch who needs a Bitch Trainer?"</p>

      <p>"I am!" She seemed ready to cream. She tried to get back at him by unzipping his fly so she could jack him off directly, but her hands failed her as she lost her concentration, so she merely fumbled around for it. Within seconds, she gave up and went back to simply stroking his bulge.</p>

      <p>He was really sawing at her ass now. He felt a sticky wetness spreading onto his open palm from her excited pussy. It had been moist before, but now it was flowing like a river. "You will NOT surprise me like that again, you understand? I'm in charge at all times, and I'll decide! Is that clear?"</p>

      <p>She whimpered, "Yes."</p>

      <p>"Who's the anal slave?"</p>

      <p>"I am." Her hand was practically wrapped around his shaft now, despite his pants, and she stroked it with a passion. Because Alan happened to wear silk underpants that day, she was able to work up a good rhythm.</p>

      <p>He purred, "You're whispering too quietly. Tell Simone and her friends what you are."</p>

      <p>"No. I can't! They look up to me."</p>

      <p>"You can forget your Bitch Training, then." He continued to saw her anus madly, knowing that anal pleasure was the key to getting her to agree to anything.</p>

      <p>He looked around frantically, and didn't see anyone else who'd paid them any special attention on the left side, aside from Simone. But then he looked to the right side at Heather's friends, and saw that the group had increased in size by two girls to a total of five. They also were moving in closer. Their very presence with their body posture indicating they were looking at something interesting was certain to draw a crowd before long.</p>

      <p>Every second that Alan had his finger working in Heather's ass seemed to weaken her resolve. Her facial expression morphed from victory to defeat mere inches from Alan's face. She looked over at Simone, and in a quiet voice but one just loud enough for rest of the group to hear, she said, "I'm an anal slave. Alan is my master. My ass master." Then she buried her face in one of her hands in embarrassment (her other hand kept stroking his bulge).</p>

      <img id="simone003c" class="center" src="part42a/simone003c.jpg" title="simone003c" alt="Simone" />

      <p>Simone's eyes went wide in shock, and her hands flew down to her crotch. She'd been painfully aroused by everything she'd seen and heard so far, but seeing the haughty Heather act so submissive practically made her cum on the spot.</p>

      <p>Alan immediately pulled his finger out of Heather's asshole, his task accomplished. He whispered, "Good girl," and withdrew his hand completely from her ass. His body pulled back as well. He looked at and sniffed his finger. While he didn't see or smell anything unusual, he was definitely planned to wash his hands before the start of his next class. His palm was practically soaked with Heather's pussy juice, plus he had an urgent need to clean the finger that had been in her asshole.</p>

      <p>That caused Heather's skirt to fall back down, though Alan was still completely obvious as to what she'd been showing the whole time.</p>

      <p>Heather though, didn't want to let go of him. She continued to jack him off through his clothes with one hand while the other remained propped up against a locker in a futile effort to make their contact appeal casual.</p>

      <p>She desperately whispered, "Can we meet for lunch?"</p>

      <p>He pushed away, and said in a low voice, "No. I told you I have other arrangements now." He looked down at himself and saw a small wet spot atop the obscene bulge straining his pants.</p>

      <p>She still clung to him, even though she knew that made her look pathetic and desperate to her group of friends. She whispered even quieter, "Then can I borrow the key?"</p>

      <p>He looked at her uncertainly, painfully aware that the break was coming to a close. He lowered his voice again. "You realize it's my key and you only get to borrow it for a short while, if at all?"</p>

      <p>"Yes."</p>

      <p>Changing the subject briefly, he announced loud enough for the other girls to hear, "I want you to shave your bush off. Today. Your body belongs to me and I don't want a jungle down there. Is that clear?"</p>

      <p>Heather practically swooned at that. "Yes!" Her knees buckled and she nearly fell to the floor, but luckily she managed to grasp the handle of a locker door and hang on for dear life.</p>

      <p>"You deserve a reward for admitting who you are to your friends. I'll open the door for you at the start of lunch. Now go." He turned and hurried down the hall to the bathroom without looking to see Heather's reaction or the reaction of the others. Had he looked, he would have seen Heather, Simone, and the others simply stare at his back in amazement as he walked away from them.</p>

      <p>Simone's hands continued to rub at her clit through her skirt, without her even realizing it.</p>

      <p>As Alan fled the scene, clutching his cum-drenched hand with his other one, he thought about Heather. <em>Fuck! I've created a monster! Even if she doesn't scheme against me, her enthusiasm is going to get me killed! That was complete insanity! Complete, idiotic insanity! My face is still black and blue and I'm already begging for another beating! It was just sheer luck no guys came walking past the whole time. Sheer luck!</em></p>

      <p>Heather stared into space dreamily after Alan disappeared around a corner. But then Simone walked up to her to speak and she snapped back to reality.</p>

      <p>The transformation of her face was incredible. She instantly went from lost and moony to looking like a harsh drill sergeant. Her eyes fell on the five other girls who had watched the whole thing and she gave them a deadly look. They had been quietly chattering amongst themselves, but quickly shut up.</p>

      <p>"Okay you lot. Come with me." Heather realized she had to make these girls completely shut up about what they'd just seen and heard. She could trust Simone to be discreet, but these others would need strong persuasion for her to be absolutely sure. Luckily, they were all members of her "Blondie" group (and in fact all of them were blonde), so she already had them more or less under her control.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_6">CHAPTER 6</h2>

      <p>Alan had a very hard time settling down after that encounter with Heather. He was able to sit through his third period class, but his dick stayed very erect.</p>

      <p>But as soon as he sat down, his teacher Mr. Jackson walked up to his desk. Even more curiously, Simone was with him, following just behind. This was very strange, since Simone wasn't in the class.</p>

      <p>Mr. Jackson spoke quietly while the other students filed in to the classroom. "Hey Alan, I've got a student aide here with something for you to do. Try not to be long, okay?"</p>

      <p>Alan looked back and forth between Mr. Jackson and Simone. He didn't understand, and it showed on his face. "What is it for?"</p>

      <p>Mr. Jackson was holding a small piece of paper, and he held it up and read it to himself. "I don't know. It just says that your presence is required by... let's see here... some visiting nurse named Ms. Hendrix." He squinted at Alan. "Is there anything wrong with you?"</p>

      <p>"Um, no. I feel fine." He looked suspiciously at Simone, since he knew her last name was Hendrix.</p>

      <p>Since she was standing a little behind Mr. Jackson, she gave Alan a sexy smile and a provocative wink.</p>

      <img id="simone028c" class="center" src="part42a/simone028c.jpg" title="simone028c" alt="Simone" />

      <p>Alan suddenly had visions of having sex with her. He wanted to be annoyed, but they weren't exactly unappealing visions.</p>

      <p>Just a few moments later, Alan and Simone were walking out of class and down the hall. Once the coast was clear, Alan said with amusement, "Nurse Hendrix, huh? I wonder who that could be."</p>

      <p>Simone smiled from ear to ear as she played stupid. "You got me."</p>

      <p>He chuckled at that, then asked, "Seriously, what's going on? I don't like being Shanghaied left and right. And I don't want to miss any of the class."</p>

      <p>"I'm aware. But I have some serious stuff to talk to you about, regarding Heather, and it can't wait. Don't worry; I don't want to miss a lot of class either."</p>

      <p>He replied, "Oh. Well, I'm okay with that then, I guess." In truth, his horniess was making him eager. "Where are we going?"</p>

      <p>"We need to talk in private. You have the key to the theater room on you, right?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah?"</p>

      <p>"Good. Let's go there."</p>

      <p>He noticed they were already headed in that direction. "How'd you get me out of class, by the way?"</p>

      <p>"Heather has a stack of passes about this high." She held her hands up, gesturing a distance of about two feet high. "I used one on myself too, of course."</p>

      <p>He sighed. "Figures. I just hope and pray that Heather's power at school will allow her to influence the football players. Has she told you yet about how they're after me?"</p>

      <p>Simone responded, "Don't worry, Heather tells me everything, and I know she's working on things already. Besides, I'm pretty well plugged in on the grapevine here at school myself, so yeah, I already know all about your situation. Let me tell you though, those guys are all bark and no bite. Nobody crosses Heather and survives to tell about it. Nobody."</p>

      <p>He grumbled as he walked along, "You make her sound like a mass murderer."</p>

      <p>She quipped, "Nah. Mass killing is too crude for her. She prefers targeted ass-ass-ination." She wiggled her hips outrageously each time she said "ass."</p>

      <p>Alan laughed, despite himself. "That has to be the worst pun I've ever heard."</p>

      <p>"Hey, you try making a joke on the spot out of mass murder. It ain't easy."</p>

      <p>"Good point. And here we are." They had reached the door to the theater room. As he unlocked the door, he thanked his lucky stars that he'd managed to get the only key to the room from Heather. Furthermore, had he let Heather borrow the key earlier, he wouldn't be able to be here with Simone now.</p>

      <p>Once Alan and Simone were safely inside the room with the door closed, he immediately turned to her and asked, "Okay, so what's so important that I had to miss class?"</p>

      <p>Simone walked to a couch and sat down on it before answering. "Several things, actually."</p>

      <p>Alan, following along, sat down next to her. "Such as...?"</p>

      <p>"The main thing concerns what happened between you and her today in the hallway. But first, before I forget, I want to mention something curious from yesterday that you might find interesting. I was hanging out with Heather in her room after school, as we usually do. One thing led to another, and we started fooling around. When I got all of her clothes off, guess what I discovered?"</p>

      <p>"What?" He was impatient to return to class, and it showed.</p>

      <p>"Some crusty, yucky cum on her ass cheeks! Can you imagine? I wonder where that came from?"</p>

      <p>His eyes widened in genuine surprise. "Oh no. She didn't."</p>

      <p>"She did."</p>

      <p>"God damn. I told her to keep that cum on her ass as just kind of a... thing. You know, it was just something to say. I thought she'd get off on the idea. I didn't expect her to actually DO it!"</p>

      <p>Simone laughed. "I know. I was pretty blown away too. But I thought I should tell you because it shows that she takes what you say seriously. I know that in general you shouldn't trust her farther than you can throw her, and you still should be wary. But when you say something, it means something to her, which in and of itself is highly unusual, believe me. Frankly, I don't even know how to read her sometimes lately, because she's acting totally out of character when it comes to you."</p>

      <p>He didn't know what to say. That was unexpected.</p>

      <p>She went on, "She told me all about your demand not to have sex with anyone else except for me and the cheerleaders. You do know that she and I have a very special relationship, don't you?"</p>

      <p>"I do. I probably don't know the half of it, but I have a general idea. And believe you me, I have no intention of getting in the way of that. My main concern is the spread of STDs. As long as you're not having sex with all kinds of strangers, it's fine with me if you do whatever the hell you want with her whenever you want. Frankly, that's not my business."</p>

      <p>"Except if there's a disease concern, and then it is your business," Simone pointed out.</p>

      <p>"Well, yeah. Sorry, but that's just being prudent."</p>

      <p>Simone nodded warily. "I understand. And you'll be glad to know that I'm only having sex with one guy right now, the wide receiver I told you about before. And he's a real straight arrow. I'm only the third girl he's had sex with, and each has been in a serious relationship. He's pushing me to go steady, but of course I can't. It's not you that would hold me back, it's the fact that I have sex with Heather nearly every day. He wouldn't understand that."</p>

      <p>"Ah. Well, thanks for telling me all that." He said impatiently, "Now, about what happened today in the hall-"</p>

      <p>"Wait a minute. You asked me to be your eyes and ears when it comes to Heather's sex partners. After talking to her yesterday, I get the sense that she's serious about limiting herself to just you, me, and the cheerleaders. She wonders how long she can go without more 'live cock' than just you, but at the same time she's not about to just up and have sex with some other guy, because she thinks they all pale in comparison to you. I even suggested she should look outside the school for more impressive partners, and she just flat out wasn't interested in that idea at all. That means you have some kind of emotional hold on her. I know she has a nasty habit of promising one thing and doing the exact opposite, but in this case you should know that she'd not blowing smoke up your ass."</p>

      <p>She paused, and then added, "Actually, she probably IS blowing smoke up your ass. Sounds like you two do all kinds of wild ass-related stuff. But what I mean is, when she's not busy tonguing your ass and blowing air up it, she's not running around and blowing smoke up other guys' asses too."</p>

      <p>He grinned. "Thanks for the clarification. Actually, that's good news. Please let me know if there's any kind of change, okay?"</p>

      <p>Simone smiled and mock-saluted. "Yes, sir. Traitorous, back-stabbing Mata Hari Hendrix at your service."</p>

      <p>"Hey, it's not like that. You're not betraying your friend in any way. On the contrary, you're helping her, big time. When she's with you, if she's anything like she is when she's with me, you know she's unreasonably wild and reckless. She's completely convinced that she'll never have to face any consequences. As your best friend, it's good if you look out for her."</p>

      <p>Simone nodded. "I know. I do feel a twinge of guilt, but you're right that it's for the greater good. You should beware, though. On the STD issue, you and I see eye to eye. But if your interests clash with her interests, I'm liable to side with her."</p>

      <p>"I know. And I understand. Thanks for being honest. Now, speaking of wild and reckless, what did you want to say about that hall encounter today?"</p>

      <p>"Ah. That. You really set the school on fire with that little stunt." She pointed to a spot on the couch just behind him. "And the fires are still burning, as I can see from the smoke rising out of your ass crack."</p>

      <p>He realized she was heading for a joke, and got there first. "No, don't worry about that; that's just the smoke that Heather's been blowing up my ass."</p>

      <p>She grinned, but said, "Darn, you stole my punch line. Anyway, as I'm sure you remember, it wasn't just you and her standing there, I was there along with a bunch of Heather's friends. And sure, I could keep my lips shut, but Heather's other friends? Not so much. In fact, Heather doesn't really HAVE other friends."</p>

      <p>He joked, "Yeah, I've heard from reliable sources that you'd have to be certifiably insane to be friends with her."</p>

      <p>"True. Too true. By the way, you should stop by my place one day and check out my insanity certificate. But anyway, her other so-called friends can't be trusted to keep a secret. Sure enough, by lunchtime, rumors were running rampant. Remember, you had Heather tell the group point blank: 'I'm an anal slave. Alan is my master. My ass master.' So... not a lot of subtlety or room for misinterpretation there."</p>

      <p>He grimaced. "Oh... yeah... That..."</p>

      <p>Simone rolled her eyes. "Yeah, that. But don't worry, I'll do my best to take care of it during lunch, and I'm sure Heather will too. In the meantime, you need to watch out!"</p>

      <p>"Thanks. Damn. Is there anything I can do, other than just 'watch out?'"</p>

      <p>"For one thing, don't be blatantly fingering Heather's ass in the hallway!"</p>

      <p>He winced. "Yeah. That was not my best moment. But you can't blame just me for that. She was all over me like some kind of excitable octopus. She was unstoppable! Believe it or not, I was doing some damage control there. I had to play along to some degree. You should have seen her. She was so horny that I seriously thought she was gonna drop to her knees and blow me right there in the hallway!"</p>

      <p>Simone pointed out, "I was there, silly. And I do know what you mean, because she was that horny, so you do have a point. And I'm partly to blame too. As you pointed out earlier, Heather is unreasonably reckless, and I kind of see myself as her guardian angel, making sure she doesn't get into TOO much trouble. A little bit of mischief is okay, though." She winked. "That's why I've agreed to be your inside source and help you out with the STD issue."</p>

      <p>He sighed. "Shit. I'll been far too careless, about too many things."</p>

      <p>"Shit, indeed. Although in your case it's probably smoke-flavored shit from all that ass blowing Heather's been doing."</p>

      <p>He looked at her in confusion.</p>

      <p>"Sorry. Once I get on a jokey riff, I tend to run it into the ground."</p>

      <p>He rolled his eyes.</p>

      <p>An idea came to her, "By the way, since I'm your secret insider, I'll need a code name. Can I be Deep Throat?" Her voice turned flirtatious, and she struck a sexy pose on the couch. "Of course, I have to earn that name, and I don't know how to deep throat yet. But I figure you can help me with practice. Lots and lots of practice!"</p>

      <p>She put a hand on his crotch. She was disappointed that he didn't have any sign of an erection, but within seconds she felt a bulge. She theatrically bugged her eyes out, and cried out in her best attempt at a Transylvanian accent, "Igor, Igor, come to the basement. It's ALIVE!"</p>

      <p>Alan laughed, but he also pulled her hand away, since he felt obliged to get back to class. He asked, "Are you trying to be Dr. Frankenstein?"</p>

      <p>She said in a pretend offended tone, "It's Dr. Fraaaankensteeein."</p>

      <p>He laughed, because he recognized the reference to dialogue in the Mel Brooks movie Young Frankenstein. Recalling more of the movie, he quipped back, "Then you should know my name is pronounced 'Eye-gore.'"</p>

      <p>She had a good laugh at that. "Touch&eacute;. I love a man who is well cultured and knows the true movie classics. That's why your code name should be Biggus Dickus." She put her hand back on his bulge, which was already larger. "I don't know why that name just came to me, but it did."</p>

      <p>Catching the Monty Python movie reference, he said, "Ah, yes. That's my vewy gweat fwiend in Wome. If that's my code name, then Heather's needs to be Intercontentia Buttocks."</p>

      <img id="simone026c" class="center" src="part42a/simone026c.jpg" title="simone026c" alt="Simone" />

      <p>Simone laughed heartily, "accidentally" and repeatedly squeezing his bulge as her body shook with the laughter. "Awesome! And fitting. It's sad how few of my friends even know the movie Life of Brian exists. But anyway, getting back to the hallway incident, it's my self-appointed role to serve as Heather's kind of guardian angel, but I just stood by and let it all happen. And you know why?"</p>

      <p>"Why?"</p>

      <p>"Because I was damn horny too! Do you realize how arousing it was to see you treat Heather like that and get away with it? To watch a red-faced Heather actually tell a bunch of her Blondie friends 'I'm an anal slave. Alan is my master. My ass master?' My God! And then to see you fingering her ass and look at all their shocked faces?! All of us were so fucking horny, it was incredible! If we'd had more time, not only would have Heather dropped to her knees to suck your cock, but I would have too! Then I would have turned to the other now kneeling Blondies as I pulled my clothes off and said, 'Sorry girls, but you've gotta wait your turn!'"</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_7">CHAPTER 7</h2>

      <p>Simone let go of his bulge, but only because she used both hands to quickly pull her top off and then undo her bra for good measure. She knew she had to work fast before he thought to put up a resistance.</p>

      <p>It was so fast that it seemed to happen in the blink of an eye for a very bewildered Alan. He was bewildered because he was quickly finding himself overcome by lust as well. He wanted to stop her, but all he said was, "You don't have to illustrate your story by, uh..."</p>

      <p>"Oh, but I do!" She returned her focus to his crotch. But this time she brought both hands there. She deftly managed to unzip his fly and whip out his erection with as much speed as she'd taken her top and bra off.</p>

      <p>He complained, "Simone, we can't do this! What about my teacher, Mr. Jackson? It's not fair to him if you waste valuable class time jacking me off."</p>

      <p>She joked, "I didn't realize he was jealous. Next time, he can jack you off. But he's not here and I am, so let me do the honors." By this time, she was already busy fondling his exposed privates with both hands.</p>

      <p>"Simoooone!"</p>

      <p>"That's my name, don't wear it out or I'll make you buy me a new one. And don't worry, you'll be Simoooooaning with pleasure before too long."</p>

      <p>He laughed. "You really are the queen of the bad puns, aren't you? And please, stop this handjob before it goes too far!"</p>

      <p>She kept on stroking, and said in parody of the famous US military slogan, "It's not just a hand job, it's a hand adventure!"</p>

      <p>He laughed some more. "You're really too much. But please, stop it already. It feels too good."</p>

      <p>"Well, we wouldn't want that."</p>

      <p>To his surprise, she did stop the handjob as soon as she said that. She stood up next to the couch and began wiggling out of the red shorts she was wearing. He was disappointed, realizing that he didn't really want her to stop. Then he realized her intentions.</p>

      <p>As she wiggled the shorts down her muscular legs, pulling her panties down with them, she said, "I'm stopping because I can't do that while you're fucking me."</p>

      <p>"Whoa! Wait a minute!" He didn't even know why he said that once he said it, because he was so horny that he was past the point of no return.</p>

      <p>She could tell his protests lacked conviction, and the way his hard-on stood up at a jaunty angle showed just how aroused he was. But she kept talking because it was taking some time to get completely naked. "By the way, did I mention that I'm STILL horny from what I saw you do to Heather earlier? I've been having an itch needing to be scratched all fucking day!"</p>

      <p>She finally had all her clothes off, so she picked up her panties and tossed them at him. "See how wet I've been! And not only that, but Heather carries on about you like you're the greatest motherfucking fucker on Earth! It's time that I find out what the hype is all about!" Since Alan still hadn't moved, she crawled back up on the couch and all over him.</p>

      <p>He couldn't resist squeezing her dark globes. "But you've already had sex with me."</p>

      <p>"I know, but let's not rush to judgment." She grinned impishly. "We need a few good fucks before I begin to make up my mind."</p>

      <p>He disengaged and stood up, but even he knew that by this point he was only playing hard to get. When she got up and wrapped her arms around him, pressing her naked body against his clothed one, he didn't resist. All he managed to say was, "Some kind of angel you are."</p>

      <p>She was all smiles. "Hey, who says devils get to have all the fun?" She knew his fly was unzipped, so she dramatically yanked his pants down nearly to his knees.</p>

      <p>He was smiling from ear to ear too. "Uh oh. I have a feeling we're about to fuck."</p>

      <p>"Brilliant deduction. Biggus Dickus? They should call you Biggus Brainus." Holding his shaft, she rose up and lowered herself down on it until he was fully impaled in her while they both remained standing up.</p>

      <p>A great surge of pleasure went through him. "Whoa!"</p>

      <p>She smirked. "That was articulate. You sound like Keanu Reeves in The Matrix."</p>

      <p>The comment made him realize that he was just reacting. He decided that it was time to get proactive. Although he knew her comment that she wanted to find out what the hype was all about was made partly in jest, he realized there was some truth to it too, and that she really did wonder why Heather was so hung up on him. He was determined to rock her world, just like he'd repeatedly rocked Heather's.</p>

      <p>With that in mind, he unexpectedly lifted her up until his dick was almost entirely out of her vagina. Then, just as unexpectedly, he suddenly dropped her back down, dramatically impaling her on his thick shaft.</p>

      <p>Simone's eyes bugged out and she yelled out incoherently. "HUUUGGYNNG!"</p>

      <p>Playfully throwing her comment back at her, she said, "That was articulate. You sound like Keanu Reeves getting strangled to death."</p>

      <p>She recovered quickly, and joked, "Sadly, a sound we have yet to hear." Obviously, she wasn't a fan of the actor's acting abilities.</p>

      <p>He realized that while fucking standing might look good to someone watching, it wasn't a very practical position. So he said, "I could stand here all day and impale you" - just then, he lifted her up and impaled her back down again - "all day long."</p>

      <p>"Sounds good!"</p>

      <p>"Or, I could bend you over the couch and fuck you doggy style."</p>

      <p>"Sounds even better!"</p>

      <p>After he impaled her a couple more times for good measure, they changed positions, allowing him to fuck her on the couch as he'd described.</p>

      <img id="simone025c" class="center" src="part42a/simone025c.jpg" title="simone025c" alt="Simone" />

      <p>As his cock slid back in her tight sheath, he thought, <em>Maaaan, that feels good. I can't believe this is happening. Here I am, fucking one of the hottest girls in school, when I should be out on the court playing tennis! Life is GOOD!</em> He laughed out loud, even as he started thrusting.</p>

      <p>Simone asked, "What's- UGH! What's so funny?"</p>

      <p>He joked, "I just realized that before long I'm gonna be Simoooaning with pleasure. Maybe even Si-moaning and Si-groaning."</p>

      <p>"UGH!"</p>

      <p>"Was that a 'bad joke' ugh or a 'damn, you're fucking me good' ugh?"</p>

      <p>"Both! Seriously! So bad, but so funny. If you keep it up, I'm going to have a tell-me-some-more-gasm!"</p>

      <p>He replied, "Ugh! And that's a 'bad joke' ugh! If you keep THAT up, I'm gonna give you a show-you-the-door-gasm."</p>

      <p>She guffawed at his quick wit.</p>

      <p>They kept on fucking, but at the same time they also kept up their playful, jokey banter.</p>

      <p>At one point, Simone pondered the situation even as Alan was fucking her hard and deep. <em>I'm starting to get why Alan is so popular with the ladies. He makes sex FUN! He knows just what to do. With Heather, he somehow figured out that she gets off on dirty and mean talk, so he gives her that. And with me, he knows I love joking around. And even though it doesn't get me off in any way, it sure as hell makes this a total blast! Even though his jokes are so bad, hee-hee! Between the joking and the fucking, I can't breathe!</em></p>

      <p>After a few minutes, the joking, and indeed any talking at all, faded away because they were going at it so energetically. Alan was still determined to give Simone a fucking she'd remember. He did have to stop at times for a minute or two to catch his breath and gather his energies, but then he'd be at it again, pounding her over the couch with great vigor.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Simone had a nice orgasm. She figured he'd cum too, and that would be the end of it. But in fact he wasn't even close to cumming yet, and he had no intention of stopping. He'd discovered that continuing to steadily fuck right through a woman's orgasm and well beyond it was a great way to make an impression, so that's what he was doing now.</p>

      <p>Simone was winded and overwhelmed by her climax. Her pussy was in a sensitive state too. So when she noticed he was still going, she panted, "Stop! Please!"</p>

      <p>But he didn't stop. Instead, he said, "You don't mean that."</p>

      <p>"No, I do. I really do!"</p>

      <p>"Trust me on this, okay? Give it another minute. If you still want to stop, then I'll stop."</p>

      <p>"Well.. okay," she groaned, still dubious.</p>

      <p>So he kept on fucking, but he slowed down some to give her body at chance to at least partially recover.</p>

      <p>There were no clocks in the room and Simone wasn't wearing a watch. As a result, she had no way of knowing when a minute had passed. She tried to count the seconds in her head, but Alan started talking to her, telling her dumb blonde jokes, of all things (he always had a bunch of those memorized to use on Christine). He asked her, "If a blonde and brunette both jumped off a building at the same time, who would land first?"</p>

      <p>Simone answered, "The brunette. The blonde would have to stop and ask directions! By the way, don't try to out joke me. I know them all!"</p>

      <p>He tried a few more jokes on her, and she knew the punch line more often than not. But in the process, he got her to forget all about counting until a minute was up. Eventually, he was so confident that she was into keeping the fucking going, he said, "Here's kind of a different one. If you're fucking a sexy girl, how do you get her to stop counting to sixty?"</p>

      <p>Simone was so preoccupied with getting fucked that she couldn't think straight. So she just asked, "Huh?"</p>

      <p>"You tell her lots of dumb blonde jokes!"</p>

      <p>She finally figured it out. "Grrr! I'm gonna get you for that one!"</p>

      <p>"Yeah, you're not exactly in a position to do that." Pleased as punch at his cleverness, he kept right on fucking her, hard and fast.</p>

      <p>She was amazed that he hadn't climaxed yet. She was nearly as amazed that he could continue talking without running out of air. What she didn't know was that it wasn't so much a matter of him being in good shape as it was a matter of getting "trained" at both things through many daily sexual adventures that involved talking more often than not.</p>

      <p>But even Alan had his limits. Once he'd told that "stop counting to sixty" joke, he went silent again and concentrated fully on the fucking. He'd already reached a point where he had to rhythmically squeeze his PC muscle to stop an imminent climax. But he also knew from recent experience that he'd gained the ability to do that nearly indefinitely (or at least until he ran out of the energy needed to continue the squeezing and the fucking).</p>

      <p>He felt he had Simone right where he wanted her. He'd gotten her to cum once, and he kept on fucking until he got her to cum again. Then they changed positions, and he laid on top of her on the couch. But, like before, he didn't give her much chance to rest and recover. It wasn't long before he fucked his way through her third orgasm.</p>

      <p>He was going to keep on going, but she started shouting, "Stop! Stop!" It sounded like she really meant it this time. He didn't feel like he knew her well enough to decide he knew better and continue fucking right through her cries to stop. So he really did come to a stop.</p>

      <p>As they rested, he said, "Your loss. If you would have let me continue, I really would have rocked your world."</p>

      <p>She panted, "You already DID rock my world! Hell, you fucked me half to death! Jeeeesus!"</p>

      <p>He laid on top of her, cuddling. "Yeah, but that's nothing. Seriously, I could have fucked you all the way to death."</p>

      <p>She realized he was serious about the fact that she'd missed out while also being joking about his exact language. "That doesn't sound so appealing. I think I prefer being fucked just short of seeing the grim reaper."</p>

      <p>He grinned and kissed her face. "I can see you've got a point there."</p>

      <p>Even though she was exhausted, she reached down and found his dick. He'd pulled all the way out, so it was resting against his thigh. "Hey! You're still hard!"</p>

      <p>"Yeah, well, I figured we were going to keep going for a while."</p>

      <p>"Oh, geez. I'm sorry. And... hey! I just realized! What about a condom? Damn, we forgot!"</p>

      <p>"No, you forgot. Once we got kind of close, I was going to put one on. But that wasn't going to be for a while yet. Actually, we could still do it. You want me to put one on now?"</p>

      <p>"Are you kidding me?! Damn! That's all I can say, is damn!" She laid under him, still panting and sweating.</p>

      <p>In truth, he'd forgotten about the condom too. But his goal was to impress her, so he was exaggerating just how long he could have lasted. With the condom comment, he was giving the impression that he was just getting started.</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>Shit! I talk a good talk about being careful about STDs, but when it comes to actual fucking, I forget more often than not! And here I thought I was so clever with that 'stop counting to sixty' joke. What an idiot!</em></p>

      <p>However, he turned the close call about the condom into an opportunity. "Hey, Simone, if we're gonna keep meeting like this, we need to be more serious about STDs. As you know, I've already been tested, and I know you have too recently."</p>

      <p>"That's right."</p>

      <p>"But don't you think it would be good if we're both tested again? And Heather too? One can never be too careful."</p>

      <p>"Yeah. Sure. Jesus Christ, at this point, I'd agree to anything. After getting fucked like that! No wonder Heather's so ga-ga over you. I know you fucked me before, and that was a lot of fun, but this was way more intense!"</p>

      <p>"Hey, we aim to please. By the way, what you just experienced is called a please-stop-I'm-much-too-sore-gasm."</p>

      <p>She had a good laugh at that. "Stop! No more jokes! If you don't kill me with the fucking, you're gonna kill me with the joking. I need to catch my breath!"</p>

      <p>Alan laid on top of her and just cuddled and rested for a while. She apologized several times for stopping before he'd had a chance to cum. He shrugged it off, appearing to be selfless about it. In fact, he was secretly relieved. He'd had plenty of fun fucking her, and since he hadn't climaxed, that meant he'd still be ready for more when he got home later. He had no doubt he'd be in for a lot more fun and sexual times before the day was over.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the two of them rested enough to get up and go back to class.</p>

      <p>Simone had made sure to talk to him in the theater room with the intention of getting him to fuck her. However, she hadn't planned on it taking so long or feeling so wiped out afterwards. He had truly impressed her with his skill and especially his stamina.</p>

      <p>Both of them made it back in time for the second half of their P.E. classes. But after all the fucking, the best they could do was go through the motions until the school day mercifully ended.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_8">CHAPTER 8</h2>

      <p>The break between third and fourth period was an extremely eventful one for Glory. She was lost in thought at the end of her third period class. Heather was in Glory's third period class on the second floor.</p>

      <p>As the class came to an end, all of Glory's students stood to leave, and she saw an opportunity to give Heather the evil eye while no one else was looking.</p>

      <p>Heather returned it with an even more menacing look. In fact, the tension between the two had been increasing over the past few days; this wasn't their first exchange of mean looks. However, neither of them dared to say anything. Glory knew that, as a teacher, she wasn't supposed to do such things, and Heather didn't want to be blatant about incurring her teacher's wrath.</p>

      <p>Heather was also in a hurry, so she flew out of the class with surprising speed. She had plans to catch Alan as he left his class down on the ground floor, so as soon as she left Glory's class she broke into a run.</p>

      <p>But Glory wasn't so worried about Heather today. Her thoughts were more on Alan and the fact that he'd be coming into the room in a couple of minutes. She couldn't shake the notion that there was something dreadfully wrong.</p>

      <p>As she got up and walked down the hallway for a bathroom break, she thought, <em>That mother role-play I put on yesterday still haunts me. I wanted to look him in the eye, but I didn't get a chance. I was so out of it thanks to the vibrators that I didn't put him to the real test. But was it that I wasn't paying proper attention, or was it that he managed to avoid looking me in the eye, because he didn't dare look me in the eye? There's so much circumstantial evidence that just leaves me with a really bad feeling. Am I risking my career and everything else on a guy who's so sex-crazed that he'd even have sex with his own sister or mother? Or both?</em></p>

      <p>She shuddered in disgust.</p>

      <p>She ruminated on this some more while she went to the bathroom. As she made her way back her classroom, she saw Katherine talking to a couple of friends in the hallway just outside the door to the teen's next class (Katherine had just come up to the second floor after giving her congratulations to Alan and being spooked by Heather). During breaks, most students tended to linger in the hallways and socialize until the very last moment.</p>

      <p>Glory walked up to Katherine, and said, "Excuse me. Can I speak to you for a moment?"</p>

      <p>Katherine was surprised. She and Glory knew each other by name, and they knew a lot about each other through Alan, but they'd hardly ever spoken directly. Katherine had never been in one of Glory's classes yet. But she couldn't say no to a teacher, so she agreed and followed Glory down the hallway. To her surprise, they entered a ladies' room, the very room Glory had just been in.</p>

      <p>Glory looked the bathroom over thoroughly, checking each stall to make sure they were alone. They were.</p>

      <p>Katherine thought Glory's scoping out the room was extremely odd, and she started getting nervous about it. Then Glory walked up to her and looked at her from an uncomfortably short distance with a strange, intense expression. That made Katherine even more nervous.</p>

      <p>Time was ticking on the class break, and Glory, as a teacher, couldn't afford to be late to her own class, but she just stared at Katherine while she tried to figure out what she wanted to say. She hadn't planned this exchange in advance, but she had an intuition that she could find out from Katherine if Alan was committing incest with her. If only she could only figure out the right thing to say, she'd have her evidence.</p>

      <p>The problem was, she couldn't just blurt out, "Are you having sex with your brother?" because it would be beyond embarrassing if she was wrong. A good twenty seconds went by while she thought, and Katherine grew increasingly flustered and nervous. She had no idea what Glory was up to.</p>

      <p>Finally, Glory simply said, "Katherine, you know that I'm involved with your brother. I want to ask you about who else he's involved with."</p>

      <img id="kath121c" class="center altImg" src="part42a/kath121c.jpg" title="kath121c" alt="Katherine" />

      <p>Katherine blanched. Her jaw dropped in surprise. She immediately assumed Glory was referring to her, even though Glory didn't say or even directly imply that. She averted her eyes and blushed profusely. She stammered, "I'm sorry, Ms. Rhymer. I don't know what you mean."</p>

      <p>Glory felt an incredible sadness. It was like a ten-ton weight had come crashing down on her head. It was more than she could bear. She looked away as well. Her brain screamed, <em>IT'S TRUE! FUCK! ALAN IS SLEEPING WITH HIS SISTER! NO! PLEASE GOD, NO!</em></p>

      <p>She muttered to Katherine, "My apologies. Never mind." Then she rushed out of the bathroom without looking at the teen again.</p>

      <p>Katherine was left confused. She just thought, <em>What the hell was that about? That was a close call! The way she was staring me down, I totally thought... Phew! I'm all tingly. I'll have to tell Brother about that. Weird.</em></p>

      <p>She hurried back to her class, unaware of just how guilty she'd looked to Glory.</p>

      <p>Glory hurried down the hall. It was fortunate for Alan that her class was on the second floor, because had she been one floor lower, she would have rushed right past Alan and Heather. If she'd noticed them, she almost certainly would have stopped to see what they were doing, and noticed that Alan was fondling, if not fingerfucking, the bitchy cheerleader's ass. That would have been the absolute worst thing she could have seen at that moment.</p>

      <p>But even as it was, Glory was beyond distraught. She wanted to scream. She wanted to throw things. She wanted to cry. The one thing she didn't want to do was teach a class. Yet that's what she had to do.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_9">CHAPTER 9</h2>

      <p>Glory walked back into her classroom right as the bell rang. Barely making it to her own class on time was quite unusual for her. She sat at her desk from some moments, shuffling papers and gathering her wits. She was determined not to look at Alan, which was a difficult task because he sat in the front row.</p>

      <p>But, in fact, he wasn't there. His outrageous ass fondling of Heather had just come to an end, and he was still in the bathroom washing his hands when the bell rang. He ran upstairs to Glory's class as quickly as he could. He burst into the room rather dramatically, still huffing and puffing, just as one of the other students was closing it.</p>

      <p>Glory couldn't help but look up to see who caused the disturbance, and when she saw it was Alan her heart leapt to her throat. She jerked her head away and said nothing.</p>

      <p>The students found her behavior quite strange. Her appearance - burning cheeks, trembling hands - was stranger still. But then, to add to the strangeness, she announced, "Hello, class. Something has come up. I want you all to write an in-class essay right now on this week's reading assignment. Um, think about something you feel strongly from that reading, and develop an argument on that. You have the entire class. I'll be back shortly."</p>

      <p>That announcement was met with groans. Most noticed that there was something not right about her demeanor, if they hadn't picked up on it already. She spoke in a robotic monotone, and stared straight ahead, above the eyes of everyone. She was trying desperately hard not to look at Alan, who had taken his seat in the front row. She fled the class as soon as the last words of her announcement left her lips.</p>

      <p>Despite his late arrival, Alan knew Glory well and also realized something was wrong, very wrong. His front row seat allowed him to see that she was trembling and tensed up while most in the back rows missed those clues. He could tell that a problem was brewing with her, but he was completely stumped as to what the problem might be. He put his head down and got to work on the in class work she'd just assigned, even though he knew it was just busy work to cover some kind of emergency.</p>

      <p>Glory didn't know where to go to have some privacy and a good cry. She didn't want Alan to go looking for her and find her. Then she remembered the supply room that she had the keys to. It was the very same supply room Alan had used to fuck his sister and Kim, in what seemed ages ago. She knew about his shenanigans with Kim in that room, and she bitterly recalled the memory. She ironically went back to the inner supply room where Alan first agreed to fuck his sister, and crumpled down to the floor. She cried.</p>

      <p>She cried and cried for many long minutes, thinking about nothing in particular, but just feeling weighted down by the entire situation. After a while, words began to form, and she thought, <em>I want to cry on someone's shoulder, but now I'm all alone. I just broke up with my boyfriend, and now I can't cry on Alan's shoulder! Poor Garth. I should have stuck with him.</em></p>

      <p><em>But Alan! God, I want him so bad, but it can't be. It's over! It has to be over. If I'm too stupid not to break up with him now too, then someone should shoot me. It's just been one thing after another with him. First, sleeping with my own student was wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong! So stupid. Then I find out that he's sleeping with other women, and do I break up with him? No! STUPID. He even steals my key to fuck another girl in this very room, and do I care? No. I find out about more and more partners, and do I care about that? No. I'm so desperate for a good fucking and desperate for love that I acted like a complete slut and an even bigger idiot.</em></p>

      <p><em>Then things get more and more dangerous with Heather and everything, and do I care? Do I say "slow down," "play it cool?" No! Stupid again! I even go and break up with my dependable boyfriend for this wild kid. The Alan I knew and loved was the most good and innocent and tender boy, but he's turned into something else. He's turned into a sexual monster who'll fuck his own sister! Where's the love? I thought he loved me, but he's only hurt me. It's like we're all just his sex slaves!</em></p>

      <p><em>He doesn't care. When I told him I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday, it barely registered. "Oh. That's nice. Thanks for that." He never calls, he never visits me outside of school - he's probably too busy fucking his sister! Face it Glory, you're just a midday fuck for an evil sex monster! And you're a dumbfuck. A DUMB FUCK. IDIOT! He's totally crushed my heart.</em></p>

      <p><em>I should have said no. I should have said no a million times over. Well, I'm saying no NOW. He's gone way too far this time. Incest? It makes me want to retch. What the hell is wrong with him? That's disgusting! Does he just fuck anything that moves? What's next? Necrophilia? Bestiality?</em></p>

      <p><em>Oh no, it could be worse, much, much WORSE! What if he is sleeping with his mother too? I know he's doing Mrs. Pestridge, and of course everybody knows about him and Amy. So he's fucking one mother-daughter team already. Mrs. Plummer would be just as sexy as her neighbor if she dressed right. Plus, no matter what she wears, it's obvious she has just about the largest set of breasts I've ever seen, and Alan is a tit man. If he's had sex with his sister, why would he stop there? ... But that is so WRONG! How could she? His sister is bad enough; probably the only hope is that Mrs. Plummer somehow resists him. This is just insane. I CANNOT BE INVOLVED WITH HIM! Period!</em></p>

      <p><em>Gloria Rhymer, what have you done? I just have to completely cut it off. I can't ever be friends with him after this, as much as that pains me. How will I ever look at him again? How will I be able to teach his class, or even keep my job?</em></p>

      <p>She buried her face in her hands and cried some more. <em>I loved him. LOVED him! He was the only one I ever loved! Hell, I STILL love him. Even after all this, I still love him! I can't bear it. I just can't! I can't go back in there into that classroom! It'll just rip my heart in two to see his cute face again.</em></p>

      <p>She cried for nearly the entire period. But she knew that she couldn't avoid her responsibilities entirely. As time started to run out on the class hour, she managed to pull herself together enough to stop crying. She went to the bathroom and cleaned up. She washed her face over and over, trying to erase the evidence of such a heavy cry, but her eyes stayed red no matter what she did. Finally she had to go back in to the room where Alan was. Her feet felt like lead as she slowly walked back to where she knew he was sitting.</p>

      <p>Glory sat at her desk without looking up and then had everyone turn in their papers. The bell rang, and the students all filed out - all but one. By this point she wished the class would never end, because she didn't want to have to be alone with Alan. But she was.</p>

      <p>By this time, Alan realized that something was terribly wrong. He'd spent most of the class thinking about what might be bothering Glory instead of fully concentrating on his assignment.</p>

      <p>At one point, he went to go find her under the excuse of taking a bathroom break, but he didn't see her anywhere. When she came back with painfully red eyes and a defeated walk, his trepidation grew. He couldn't think what could be bothering her so much unless it had to do with him. Everything else in her life was going fine as far as he knew, and the breakup with her boyfriend had been a long time coming to what seemed like a loveless relationship anyway. The more he thought about it, the more he figured it was either some horrible new scheme of Heather's or Glory had found out about the incest. His worst fear was that Heather had told her about the incest. By the end of the class he was almost sure that's what it was.</p>

      <p>The others were all gone. Alan stood in front of Glory's desk, waiting. She resolutely kept her head down. Finally, he said, "Glory, I can tell that something's obviously wrong. Do you want to talk about it?"</p>

      <p>Without looking up, she simply said, "I know."</p>

      <p>Alan blanched just as his sister had. His body immediately went into panic mode, but he stood his ground and tried not to broadcast his emotions. He had a very good idea what she knew.</p>

      <p>Then she repeated soberly, "I know." She added, "I know about you and your sister. I ran into her before class, and I could tell just from looking at her face. I can't... We can't... It's over. Please leave now. You have to go."</p>

      <p>She still didn't look up. She hoped that he would silently walk out and she'd never have to see his face again. She knew it would be very painful to look at him.</p>

      <p>He was stunned, even though he'd suspected this, but he didn't leave. His mind was too frazzled to think. It wasn't just that she knew about the incest; his worst fears had come true and she'd chosen to break up as well. It was all too much to take. He'd been under a lot of stress lately in trying to juggle all of the women in his life and keep them happy, and he felt as if all of the balls in the air had just all fallen to the ground.</p>

      <p>He fell to his knees and then dropped forwards onto her desk. He buried his face in his hands just as Glory had done in the supply closet, and cried. Just as happened to her, he had a pure outpouring of emotion that seemed to have no end. He was so overcome that he couldn't control himself. He almost forgot that Glory was sitting there right in front of him. When he would remember, his reaction was just like Glory's: he wished she was gone because he couldn't bear to look at her.</p>

      <p>He cried into his own arms for a long time. It went on at least twenty minutes. From time to time he paid enough attention to hear the sound of Glory crying as well. Eventually her tears dried up and she stopped and just stared at his head. His crying slowed down too, until it was more a series of sobs.</p>

      <p>At one point, he thought, <em>I'm some kind of hypocrite, or selfish bastard, certainly. Hell, I just got a double blowjob from Mom and Sis this morning. I'm involved with too many women, and they're all amazing. Why the hell would I need Glory too? But I do! I really do! I LOVE her! It's not just a sexual thing, or even mainly a sexual thing, although the sex with her is great. I love her! I don't care how many other women are in my life, if she breaks up with me, it's gonna break my heart.</em></p>

      <p><em>But how could she ever understand? She must think I don't really care very much.</em></p>

      <p>Finally Glory spoke. She said, "Jesus, are you ever going to stop crying? I-" Her voice broke as she struggled to continue. "I didn't expect that reaction from you."</p>

      <img id="glory072c" class="center" src="part42a/glory072c.jpg" title="glory072c" alt="Glory" />

      <p>Alan froze and looked up at her. They made eye contact for the first time since before she'd talked to Katherine. Mascara-smeared tears still ran down her cheeks.</p>

      <p>He said, "What do you expect? I'm crying because I love you. I don't want to lose you."</p>

      <p>That started a whole new round of crying from both of them.</p>

      <p>Alan couldn't bear it. He got up and moved around the desk until he was kneeling at her side.</p>

      <p>Then he and she kept crying even as they tightly held each other.</p>

      <p>After some more minutes their mutual crying died down, and Glory asked, "Why? Why, Alan, why? How many women are enough for you? Why did it have to be her, too? Or was it... them? Is it, is it, it, more then your sister? Please, God, I NEED to know now!"</p>

      <p>He closed his eyes and admitted, "It's them. The two of them." Having to say that felt worse than being punched in the gut.</p>

      <p>Glory shrieked and fell to her knees. She burst into a new round of gut-wrenching tears. <em>My God! His mother too! I'm gonna be SICK!</em></p>

      <p>Alan had no idea what to do. He feared that if he tried to hug her, that would backfire. So he remained standing and waited until she calmed down a minute or two later, and then he said, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you, sorry that I hurt you and kept the truth from you. But I'm not sorry about what I've done with them. I'm proud of it. We love each other. It isn't wrong! Love is love. Why is physical love so separate from other kinds of love? Why can't I love the women in my life physically, too? Why is that so wrong? Hell, I'm not actually genetically related to either of them. You know that. I love you, Glory. I love them. I want to kiss and hug - and more - with the women I love. Why can't I, if we all want it? Why?"</p>

      <p>She reluctantly stood up. She still couldn't bear to look at him, but his tear soaked cheek rested on hers as the two of them stared together across the classroom into empty space. "It's wrong. It just is. It leads to sorrow. People are made just to have one partner. And the reasons against incest go very deep. It's not just a matter of genes - they are your family." She sighed heavily. "I don't want to talk about it."</p>

      <p>He muttered, "I don't agree. You just don't understand how it is." But he let it drop for the time being, since she said she didn't want to talk.</p>

      <p>They just held each other and stared out into space for a while longer. Then Glory turned to him, and from inches away said to his face, "Alan, you mean so much to me, but this can't go on. Our whole relationship was insanity from the beginning. I should never have done this. This is a good excuse to call it off. We have to, before it destroys us both. Look at your face with your bruised nose and everything. If you keep this up and just recklessly fuck anyone you want, a few bruises will be nothing compared to the hurt you'll face, especially the emotional hurt. I can't be a part of it. Don't try to argue. That's the way it has to be."</p>

      <p>"That's not how it has to be, Glory! I know what we've done and that all this sneaking around has been hard on you, but I love you!"</p>

      <p>"Stop saying that! It's killing me!"</p>

      <p>"But it's true. It's so true. Doesn't love conquer all? If we love each other, we can overcome anything!"</p>

      <p>Glory started crying again, but also said through her tears, "How can you say that? How can you keep saying you love me when you have a girlfriend, and you're doing ... THAT to your sister and mother? Look, I can't take any more of this. I need some time to think. And..."</p>

      <p>She looked at the clock on the wall, "Good God! Look at the time. How are you going to have time to eat lunch and show your face to your friends, so people don't suspect? This is the problem. Incest and girlfriends aside, we're riding the razor's edge and it's just a matter of time until we fall. It has to end!"</p>

      <p>Alan stood up and held her hands. He looked at her intently, and her eyes were drawn to his. He said passionately, "Glory, I love you. I'll say it again: I love you! I'll keep saying it until you realize it, because I won't stop loving you no matter what happens. You must think I don't love you strongly because I have these other lovers in my life, but that's not true. A person can have more than one friend, and they can have more than one love. I can't live without you!"</p>

      <p>She snorted derivisely. "HA!"</p>

      <p>He admitted, "Okay, obviously I'd live, but I just can't put into words how much you mean to me. This isn't just something where I'm getting off on having sex with one of my teachers. I love you! I really love you! Don't you believe that?!"</p>

      <p>After a long pause, she nodded. "I do. That's what makes this so hard!" A new worry came to her. "And what's going to happen when you go off to college next fall? We've talked about that, and we both know you're very likely going to go to UC Berkeley. If we were still together then, how would that work? And what are your... you-know-who? What would they do?"</p>

      <p>He winced. "To be honest, I haven't really thought things through. I'm sure it'll work out one way or another for all of us, because true love conquers all."</p>

      <p>She groaned unhappily. "You can't repeat a clich&eacute; like 'true love conquers all' and expect that to solve everything. You're so immature sometimes! I can't believe I ever got involved with you in the first place!"</p>

      <p>He wanted to cry some more. "Promise me you won't make any final decisions and just think about it for a few days? Okay? I'll be gone hiking all weekend anyways. Promise me we'll talk some more on Monday? After school?"</p>

      <p>She looked at his sincere face and felt her heart melt. She felt as if she was falling in love with him all over again. She had to turn away before the feelings got too intense. Staring at the far wall, she said, "I'll promise we'll talk some more, but that's it. Okay? You really have to go now. I absolutely have to pull myself together. You've turned me into an absolute wreck! Again!"</p>

      <p>So Alan left. He wandered out of the classroom in a daze. His plans for the rest of the day and beyond were in tatters. Not even the prospect of fucking his mother mattered to him at this point. He loved Glory deeply with much more than physical love, and he didn't want to lose her. He resolved not to give up, not yet. But he realized that the future with her looked very grim.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_10">CHAPTER 10</h2>

      <p>Alan went to the cafeteria to eat lunch, since there was nothing else he could say or do to make things better with Glory. Even though his lunch period was halfway over, he dragged himself along instead of hurrying.</p>

      <p>As soon as he reached the cafeteria, Heather was there to meet him. She was very eager to get the theater room key from him, so she'd been looking all over for him. Luckily, she was so eager to accomplish her goal that she didn't really notice his forlorn look. Alan didn't want to talk about his problems with anyone at that moment, and especially not with Heather, so he gave her the key and she hurried off.</p>

      <p>Christine also had been looking for Alan so they could talk and clear the air after their kissing the night before. She wanted to make sure their friendship could continue and grow, but on a purely platonic level. She'd already finished eating, so when he made it through the food line she got up and waited for him, to make sure there was no way he could avoid her. Then they walked outside, since she didn't want anyone to overhear in case there were overt mentions of the kissing.</p>

      <p>However, by the time they sat on the grass, she noticed something was wrong. She asked, "Is everything okay? You look really bummed. When I last saw you at the end of third period you were in a much better mood. What's happened since then?"</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>Crap! What am I supposed to say to that? "Oh, no biggie. It's just that I'm bummed out that my history teacher, whom I've been having sex with, by the way, found out that I'm also having sex with my sister." Man! Christine would probably sock me in the jaw! Especially after what we did last night!</em></p>

      <p><em>You see? This just goes to show, this is EXACTLY why Christine and I could never get together. Glory is livid to find out about the incest, but Christine would literally explode like a nuclear bomb! Who knows, she might even lash out physically before she got herself under control. But I can't sit here just feeling sorry for myself, or she'll get suspicious!</em></p>

      <p>Needing an excuse or two, he told her a partial truth at best. "Yeah... At that point, I thought I did pretty okay on my three tests. But the more I think about it, the more I realize I didn't do well at all. And it's all my fault! I've been slacking big time lately, and I never did that before. I don't know what's gotten into me. Worse, I've got this Boy Scouts trip coming up this weekend. So instead of being able to use my frustration to go on a tear and get all caught up, I'm gonna have to ruminate for two whole days about how crappy I did. The trip is probably ruined already."</p>

      <p>Luckily for Alan, Christine took her studies very seriously indeed. As a result, she had no trouble at all believing that his worries about his test scores had profoundly depressed him. She asked, "That sucks. Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>

      <p>He saw an opportunity to bring up the awkward topic of how to move on from their brief yet intense make-out session the night before, by making light of it. With a lopsided grin and exaggerated eyebrow wiggling he asked, "How 'bout a nice hug and kiss, like the kind we had last night?"</p>

      <p>That had been a risky move, since he wasn't sure if she'd take that in the right spirit. But he was relieved when she had a good laugh. "Yeah, right! You wish!"</p>

      <p>He felt his sadness genuinely passing, at least momentarily, while they shared some friendly laughter. Smiling more widely, he raised an eyebrow and said, "Okay, instead of a kiss, how 'bout if I just fondle your boobs for a while? That'll cheer me right up!" He reached out towards her without actually touching her, and squeezed his hands in the air like a hungry crab searching for food.</p>

      <p>She laughed some more. "Fat chance!" She added more seriously, "You know that can't happen again, right?"</p>

      <p>He nodded. "Of course. But that doesn't mean I can't tease you about the possibility, from now until forever."</p>

      <p>She laughed some more. "Oh no! I'm in trouble now!" But she was really glad at how things were going. She had been dreading bringing up the kissing topic, but the way Alan had addressed it with joking actually made it into something fun. And she liked the fact that if they couldn't kiss or touch anymore, at least they could tease each other about it.</p>

      <p>He didn't want to push his luck though, so he asked, "How do you think you did on your tests? Aced them as usual, I'll bet."</p>

      <p>She knew she had aced them, but she replied with a modest answer instead.</p>

      <p>As Alan listened, he felt his sadness descend on him again, even though he forced a smile. <em>Uuuuuugh! I wish so much there was some way I could have Christine as a girlfriend. Not only is she as hot as the center of a supernova, she's just so much fun to be with. It's weird that she comes across as stand-offish to everyone else, 'cos we've got such a good rapport now. I'll have to admit it took me a long time to get through her shell though. And now that we've made it this far, all we can do is joke about kissing and stuff.</em></p>

      <p><em>What happened with Glory today has to be a lesson for me. God knows I have enough sexy fun in my life already; I can't get too greedy. I need both Glory and Christine as friends. I like 'em both so much! As it is, I'll be lucky if I can save my friendship with Glory at all. I'll deserve everything I get if I turn around and make the exact same mistake I made with her with Christine. Even I'm not THAT dumb!</em></p>

      <p>When Christine came to the end of her answer, she sipped from the carton of milk that she'd bought in the cafeteria.</p>

      <p>Alan acted shocked and appalled. "What do you think you're doing?!"</p>

      <p>Confused, she lowered the carton. "What?"</p>

      <p>He opened his eyes wider. "You're drinking milk! You! Milk!" He urgently waved his hands in the air.</p>

      <p>She chuckled, even though she still didn't understand what he was getting at, especially since he certainly would remember that she frequently drank milk at lunch. "Why is that bad?"</p>

      <p>He continued with pretend distress, "It's not bad, per se. It's just... too much. It's like... taking a bucket of sand to the Sahara Desert. I mean, you're carrying two gallon jugs of milk around with you all the time anyway. If you keep filling those with even more milk, your boobs will grow bigger and bigger until... until I die!"</p>

      <p>She laughed. "Normally, I'd be offended by the 'gallon jugs' comment, but since it's you I'll let that slide. So, pray tell, how are you gonna die?"</p>

      <p>"Okay, admittedly, maybe I won't die. But I'll wind up in the emergency room, at least. You know those Viagra commercials that mention needing to seek medical help if you have an erection longer than four hours?"</p>

      <p>She laughed some more. Plus, she was happy to finally understand where he was going with this. She teased, "Sucks to be you. Mmmm. Boy, I feel thirsty all of a sudden." She took a big swig from the milk carton. Then she looked down at her rack. "Hmmm. Did I just feel a growth spurt coming on? I think I did!"</p>

      <p>He gulped theatrically, pulling at his collar in an exaggerated fashion as if it were suddenly too tight.</p>

      <p>She laughed still more, delighted by the playful, sexy fun. She decided to up the ante. Smirking, she took advantage of the fact that she was wearing a shirt that buttoned in the front. As she unbuttoned the button at the top, she said in a surprisingly sultry voice, "Is it just me, or is it hot out here?"</p>

      <p>Alan's jaw dropped, which he didn't need to fake. "Whoa! Watch out! You're too hot! I swear, the milk in your gallon jugs is gonna curdle!"</p>

      <img id="christine166c" class="center" src="part42a/christine166c.jpg" title="christine166c" alt="Christine in a green blouse with a milk carton in her right hand, winking at Alan" />

      <p>She found that very amusing and laughed even harder. Knowing full well that he was watching her every move with bated breath, she undid another button on her blouse. Having two buttons undone wasn't really that big a deal, since her blouse was still buttoned enough to not be really risqu&eacute;, but it showed a scandalous amount of cleavage compared to her normal school standards. Then she raised the milk carton to her face and struck a proud pose with a hand on a hip. Pretending to be an actress in a commercial, she winked and said, "Milk: it does a body good!"</p>

      <p>He wiped pretend sweat from his forehead. "Phew! It DOES! And dang! It just got way, way hotter! Now I'm concerned that all that milk is gonna get pasteurized!"</p>

      <p>She practically doubled over, she was laughing so much at that. Once she stopped she said, "You do know that a woman's breasts are not actually completely filled with milk, especially if she's not lactating. Right?"</p>

      <p>"You coulda fooled me." He reached out towards her chest, although he clearly wasn't close enough to actually touch her. "Can I check right now? If I recall correctly, yesterday when I squeezed them, I definitely heard a sloshing sound. In fact, I remember hearing a moo."</p>

      <p>Laughing, she swatted his hand away. "Behave! Besides, mooing? That doesn't even make sense." Suddenly remembering they were in a public place, she quickly looked around to check if anyone was paying attention to them. She was relieved to see that no one was. But that reality scare caused her to change the subject and end the teasing, at least for the moment.</p>

      <p>She also re-buttoned the lower of the two buttons she'd just undone, saying, "Okay, kid, the free show is over."</p>

      <p>He pouted theatrically, "Awwww... You're no fun."</p>

      <p>She snorted with amusement. "Right!"</p>

      <p>Once Alan was gone, Christine quickly re-buttoned her blouse completely. She found herself thinking, <em>Boy, that was great! I swear, I NEVER behave like this, but with him, it feels so right. I thought things were going to be all awkward after what happened last night, but it's just the same as ever. Well, not exactly the same: the flirtation has definitely gone up a notch. Okay, a lot. But I can roll with the punches! I was so worried that what happened could ruin our friendship, but maybe it'll make things even better between us?</em></p>


      <h2 id="chapter_11">CHAPTER 11</h2>

      <p>Alan remained distraught.</p>

      <p>Not only was the situation with Glory bad, but on the way to his sixth period tennis class, some football players started to intercept him. They clearly looked like they were going to do something nasty to him as they pushed their way through other students to get to him and block his exit.</p>

      <p>Luckily for Alan, they veered away when they saw a teacher walking nearby, but this was a painful reminder that his confrontation with them was far from resolved, and that he was acting recklessly with both Heather and Glory.</p>

      <p>Then Alan had his fifth period test, the last of three important tests that day. In a way, he was glad, because being forced to concentrate about his test enabled him to put his sadness about Glory out of his mind for a little while. But when the test finished, his woes came right back.</p>

      <p>When Alan's last class of the day ended, he was surprised to see Simone come up to him again. She smiled at him, and then pressed a key into his hand. "Hey, what's up? Heather wanted me to give you this."</p>

      <p>He looked at the key he'd been given, and saw that it was the theater room key. He realized that he was so spaced out from his woes with Glory that he'd forgotten about getting it back from Heather. But he was very glad. He certainly didn't want her to keep it overnight, for fear that she might make a copy.</p>

      <p>He would have been chagrined to learn that Heather had done exactly that during lunch! She'd told him the day before that no locksmith would make a copy of the key, but she'd been lying. So she took advantage of Alan loaning her the key to drive to a nearby shop, have the key copied in a couple of minutes, and return to school. (That made her late to her fifth period class, but she didn't care much about that.)</p>

      <p>It seemed that no matter how much Alan attempted to assert dominance over her, she just had to rebel. At least he would have been gratified to find out that Simone was clueless about the key copying. She just thought she was doing Heather a favor by helping her give the key back in a timely manner.</p>

      <p>Once Alan thanked Simone for helping with the key, he gave her a quick explanation about his near confrontation with some football players that had taken place just an hour earlier.</p>

      <p>Simone responded, "I'm not surprised. Remember what we were talking about before, about some football players who aren't so pleased with you right now?"</p>

      <p>"Oh yeah." He'd forgotten all about that until she mentioned it.</p>

      <p>She laughed. "You're just as spaced out as I am!"</p>

      <img id="simone029c" class="center" src="part42a/simone029c.jpg" title="simone029c" alt="Simone" />

      <p>He nodded. "That's true. But in my defense, you and I said and did some things that were much more memorable." He thought back to fucking Simone earlier in the day. As he did, he pictured her naked where she was standing. She had a truly impressive muscular body, even by his recent sky-high standardds.</p>

      <p>She chuckled. "That's true. However, I said I would help with damage control for you today, and I did. I tried my best to spread the word during lunch. I had to concede that you two were getting it on. I said that you two were engaged in an escalating series of dares. So it was just a dare that she said that and she didn't literally mean that you're her master or that she's an 'anal slave,' whatever the hell that is. Heather was there for the first part of lunch, so she was able to corroborate my story."</p>

      <p>He asked, "Couldn't you have just stonewalled about me having sex with her?"</p>

      <p>Simone griped, "Alan, get real. Not only did you make her say that, but we all saw you fingering her ass! Her short cheerleader skirt rode up and we could see your finger up her asshole, practically in to your knuckle! It's way weird that she'd be hugging someone like you with an audience watching. But with your finger up her ass, and her humping herself onto it while everyone is stunned speechless and staring in shock? Try explaining that away!"</p>

      <p>That left him without any answer. "Oooh... Hmmm... So... what does it mean, that news about this has gotten out?"</p>

      <p>"Lucky for you, it hasn't gotten completely out. As you may or may not know, Heather has a group of girl friends and ass-lickers around her known as the 'Blondies.' They're the ones who know the truth now about you and Heather. All of the actual eyewitnesses are members of her clique. As you go further from that group, and those friends tell their friends and so on, hopefully fact will turn into rumor. The one thing you have going for you is that the idea of Heather having sex with you is so absurdly unbelievable."</p>

      <p>He asked, "It's not THAT unbelievable, is it?"</p>

      <p>"It is. Think about it. What if someone walked up to one of your friends and said they'd just heard that you had sex with Heather? How would they react?"</p>

      <p>He admitted, "They'd laugh and say something like, 'Yeah, right.' Then they'd joke about me having delusions of grandeur."</p>

      <p>"You see? Most people don't know you from Adam. But if they do, for instance if you're mentioned in a rumor about Heather, they call you 'Alan the nerd' or 'Alan the straight A teacher's pet' or the like. And anyone who knows Heather at all knows that she'd rather, well, have a factory chimney's worth of smoke blown up her ass than say 'boo' to a nerd. No, I take that back, she'd probably get off on all that anilingus. But you get what I mean. The fact that she'd have sex with a nerd is what makes that worth telling. But at the same time, it's so improbable that it turns the fact into a wild rumor. Or at least that's what I'm hoping."</p>

      <p>"God, I hope so too. I'm having enough trouble with the football players as it is."</p>

      <p>"Yeah, well, unfortunately, a lot of those football players out to get you are close to the Blondies. For instance, remember how my boyfriend is a wide receiver. So to them it'll probably be more fact than rumor, since they'll be hearing it straight from the girls who actually saw and heard it, or maybe just one step removed."</p>

      <p>He said with concern, "Wait a minute. If that's true, I'm thinking that those guys who were out to get me today might have heard this latest gossip."</p>

      <p>Simone nodded sagely. "That's not a maybe, that's a near certainty. The news spread like wildfire during lunch, and that was the first chance they could get to you. They also know for certain that you're dating Amy. Guys like you aren't supposed to date beautiful girls like Amy, much less have sex with Heather on top of that. So I'm sure they were out to put you in your place."</p>

      <p>"Dammit!"</p>

      <p>She gravely agreed. "Yeah, it's not good. But don't worry-" Something caught her eye, and she interrupted herself to say, "Oh wait, look. Some girl is in a hurry to talk to you. I'll drop back so you can see what it's about. But don't worry; I'll be keeping an eye on you. I've got your back."</p>

      <p>"Thanks."</p>

      <p>Simone dropped back while he kept on walking.</p>

      <p>But he also turned around to see what she was talking about. Sure enough, some girl he didn't even know rushed up to him, all breathless and excited.</p>

      <p>"Alan!" she said. "Hey. I was wondering, you know, if you might want to, um, well, maybe go out some time?"</p>

      <p>He looked her over. She was cute. Actually, she crossed the line from cute into downright beautiful. She had very lovely long blonde hair and was fairly stacked to boot. He guessed she was a C-cup. But he didn't know her name. Then, as he continued to look at her, he realized that she was one of the five "Blondies" who had seen him with Heather in the hallway earlier.</p>

      <p>He reached out his hand to shake hers. "I hate to say this, but I'm afraid I don't know your name."</p>

      <p>She shook his hand eagerly. "Yeah, that's probably 'cos you're a senior and I'm only a sophomore. But everyone says I look like I'm a couple of years older, at least."</p>

      <p>He looked her over again and certainly didn't disagree with that. "Yeah, well, you definitely are a stunner. Um, what's your name?"</p>

      <p>"Oh! Sorry! I'm Mindy." She still held his hand, though it was more of a gentle caress than a firm grip.</p>

      <p>"Well, Mindy, I wish I could say yes, but I really can't. I'd love to go out with you, but there are some things that make that impossible right now."</p>

      <p>She looked crestfallen.</p>

      <p>He could almost read her mind from her expression. It was like she was pleading, <em>Those things you did to Heather, do them to me too!</em> He could feel a boner growing in his pants as he realized the eagerness of this girl to do sexual things with him. But he knew there was no way he could give in. He was so overcommitted already that the mere idea made him feel more exhausted than excited.</p>

      <p>However, she didn't give up easily. "What kind of things?"</p>

      <p>"Unfortunately, I can't say. But it's not that I don't want to. You look like the kind of person I wish I could get to know better, but I just can't."</p>

      <p>She pressed, "I know you're dating Amy Pestridge, but I also know you're not going steady with her. If fact, she's totally okay with you having fun with other girls, right?"</p>

      <p>He said, "It's complicated. I'm not at liberty to explain, but I do have some entanglements. Trust me, if things were different, I'd love to go out with you. You're very pretty, and you seem nice. If things change I'll definitely let you know, okay?"</p>

      <p>"Okay." She walked away slightly dejected, even though he'd done his best to let her down easy.</p>

      <p><em>Dang, man,</em> Alan thought. <em>What is it with girls around here? Does everyone want to be treated like a submissive fuck toy or something? I almost want to shake her by the shoulders and say, "Hey! Get a grip. Go find a normal boyfriend and have a normal relationship. Stay away from me. Not only am I way overextended, but I would be downright bad for you. Really."</em></p>

      <p><em>God, and she's totally doable too. In another year she'll be extremely ripe. She could be Christine-type hot eventually. Somehow that just makes me twice as frustrated.</em></p>


      <h2 id="chapter_12">CHAPTER 12</h2>

      <p>Alan mulled over his situation as he walked to the bicycle racks. Lately, more and more girls had been asking him out. He'd turned them all down, no matter how appealing they were; he simply had no choice. He was realizing that he wasn't good at "fuck and run" - he tended to get too involved, and there just wasn't enough of him to go around.</p>

      <p>But he realized that at least that problem had temporarily kept his mind off more disturbing problems, like Glory breaking up with him or the football players being after him. However, thinking that thought reminded him of what had happened with Glory earlier in the day. That got him depressed all over again.</p>

      <img id="amy010c" class="center altImg" src="part42a/amy010c.jpg" title="amy010c" alt="Amy" />

      <p>When he reached his bike, he was surprised to see Amy waiting there. "Hey, Beau!" she said, accompanying it with a big smile and a friendly wave.</p>

      <p>Alan replied glumly, "Hey, Aims."</p>

      <p>"What's up?"</p>

      <p>"Not much." He started to unlock his bike. "I'm surprised to see you still here. What are you waiting for?" It went without saying that almost everyone else had left immediately after school let out.</p>

      <p>He looked around for Simone again, and saw her walking away. Apparently, she figured he was safe enough if he was with Amy, especially since there was no sign that any of the football players were still hanging around. He thought to himself, <em>Thanks, Simone!</em></p>

      <p>Amy said, "I'm waiting for you, silly. That's the kinda stuff good girlfriends do, right?"</p>

      <p>He looked up at her and forced himself to smile. "You're the best." Noticing that she was wearing her cheerleader outfit, he realized that meant it was a Friday game day, when the cheerleaders usually wore their uniforms all day to help raise school enthusiasm for the football game. He asked, "Don't you have to be at the game."</p>

      <p>"I'm going there in a minute. But first I wanted to make sure you're okay."</p>

      <p>"Awww, Aims. You're so sweet. The thing is, I don't deserve it."</p>

      <p>She frowned. "Uh-oh, Beau. You're looking and sounding super bummedy. Did something bad happen to you today?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah, you could say that." He finished unlocking his bike and pulled it out of the rack.</p>

      <p>"Oh no! What?! Is there anything I can do to help?!"</p>

      <p>He looked around and saw that a few other people were still getting their bicycles. "Can you walk with me out to the street? I kinda wanta talk in private."</p>

      <p>"M'kay."</p>

      <p>They reached the point where they both would normally have gotten on their bikes and started to ride him. But Alan just stood there next to his bike, since Amy obviously couldn't bike off with him. Deciding these were in a private enough spot, he said, "There's a lot of things on my mind right now." Thinking about the situation with Glory, he said, "I don't want to discuss the main thing that's bothering me right now. But don't worry; it has nothing to do with you, and it's nothing you should worry about. Instead, I'd like to talk about how I'm not worthy of having a great girlfriend like you."</p>

      <p>He was going to add that he also wasn't worthy of all the love and sexual attention at home, but even saying that much seemed too dangerous, given the importance of keeping the incest secret. He figured it would be better if they were off school grounds, so he suggested, "Why don't we just walk a little bit while we talk?"</p>

      <p>"M'kay. Cool."</p>

      <p>They started doing just that, with Alan walking his bike along.</p>

      <p>Alan sighed. "Aims, I'm such a cad. Do you know what that means?"</p>

      <p>"What's that?"</p>

      <p>"It's a guy who behaves irresponsibly or dishonorably with women. He just does whatever he feels like without regard for their feelings. That's how I'm feeling right now. I mean, I'm like a kid in a candy store. Girls, for some reason, are really into me these days. I can't say no. I've gotta eat all the candy until I'm sick."</p>

      <p>"That's not true," Amy said. "Some girl tried to chat you up just now, and you totally shot her down. But in a nice, polite way, I'm sure, 'cos you're a nice guy."</p>

      <p>Alan looked at her with surprise. "You saw that?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah. I was behind you, 'cos I wanted to go home with you. I was about to catch up, but when I saw you two start to talk I kinda checked out the scene and then walked on."</p>

      <p>He sighed. "Yeah, well..."</p>

      <p>She cut in. "And she was a hottie too! True, not a super hot hottie, like..." She looked around, as she pondered mentioning Susan, Suzanne, and Katherine. Even though they were walking side by side down a deserted suburban street, she still felt the need to be vague. "You know, like certain people, who I don't think I even need to name."</p>

      <p>He was relieved, but reinforced the need for discretion. "You don't. You definitely don't."</p>

      <p>She continued, "If I were a dude, I'd wanna do her! What's her name?"</p>

      <p>"Mindy. She's a friend of Heather's, I guess. And by the way, she's not the first cutie to ask me out lately. I've turned them all down." He was feeling down, and he wanted to get the conversation back to how he felt he was a cad. "But before you start giving me kudos for that, I should mention what happened last night."</p>

      <p>"Uh-oh." Amy stopped walking, forcing him to stop too. "What happened? Was it when you went out to study with Christine?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah. And we did study, at a pub. It was good and helpful, actually. But we kinda got a little flirty, and one thing led to another, and we kissed. On the lips." He hastened to add, "But that was it! It was just a little kissing, and then we both stopped and realized that wasn't a good idea. We vowed to stay platonic only."</p>

      <p>Amy stared at him hard. The resulting silence was prolonged and painful. Clearly, she wasn't happy.</p>

      <p>Finally, she asked, "Kissing, huh? Was it open-mouthed, tongue-dancing kind of kissing?"</p>

      <p>He lowered his head shamefully. "Yeah. Kinda."</p>

      <p>"And did your hands wander?"</p>

      <p>He admitted, "Yeah. But just, like, for a minute." Curiosity got the best of him and he glanced up at Amy. He saw she was clenching her teeth.</p>

      <p>"Did you feel her boobs? Her giganto-big wonder boobs?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah, but super quick. And through her blouse." The 'super quick' part wasn't completely accurate, but he could see that Amy was pissed and he didn't want to throw more fuel on the fire at the moment.</p>

      <p>There was more silence as Amy turned her back and took a few steps away from Alan. Then she let out a surprisingly loud, "GRRRR!"</p>

      <p>Alan propped his bike up and went walking after her. "Aims, I'm sorry! This is what I was saying about how I'm a cad. Sometimes I can't control myself!" He put a hand on her shoulder, trying to be consoling.</p>

      <p>But she squirmed and brushed his hand away. "Don't you 'Aims' me! I am NOT happy!"</p>

      <p>He felt terrible, because he knew how rare it was for Amy to get upset about anything. "Oh, man! I'm really sorry!"</p>

      <p>Amy suddenly turned around to face him. She spoke in clipped tones, because it was obvious that she was trying hard to control her emotions. "You know I'm totally cool with sharing you, but Christine... she's different. She's just so, well... awesome! She's too great at everything. And too beautiful. And, well, too darn busty! How am I supposed to compete?! She's better than me at everything!"</p>

      <p>Suddenly her anger turned to insecurity and she looked on the verge of crying.</p>

      <p>Alan swept her into her arms. She didn't resist his touch this time. As he hugged her tightly he said, "That's not true! There's one thing you're WAY better at than she is!"</p>

      <p>"What's that?"</p>

      <p>"Being Amy! You're the bestest, Amy-est Amy ever! I know that sounds silly, but it's true. Only you can be Amy. Nobody else can! You and me, we've been pals ever since we were in diapers. You have a special place in my heart that goes waaaaay back, long before we became boyfriend and girlfriend. You, Mom, Sis, and your mom, you all have special places in my heart that no one else could ever fill. Everyone else, they have to fight for whatever is left over."</p>

      <p>Amy was encouraged by that, enough to keep her tears at bay. But she still needed more reassurance. "But Christine, she's-"</p>

      <p>He interrupted. "I don't care! She could fly and fart out gold bricks, and it doesn't matter! She's not you! You're so adorable and wonderful and kind and loving! Just thinking about your always smiling face makes me happy. You light up my life with joy. I love you! And now we've got this sexual thing too, and that makes everything else even better! Don't sell yourself short in the beauty department, by the way. You're a 'super hot hottie' too! And yeah, maybe you don't win awards and get good grades like she does, but so the fuck what? She couldn't hold a candle to your artistic skill. Everybody is good at different things. And what you're best at is being totally lovable! I love you, dammit, and don't you ever forget it!"</p>

      <p>Amy was clearly feeling better. She stared up into his eyes adoringly. "Oh, Beau! I love you too!"</p>

      <p>They kissed with tremendous passion.</p>

      <p>Had they not been standing on a sidewalk on some random suburban street, the kissing undoubtedly would have led to more. But they remained mindful of their situation, so made sure to keep their clothes on and their hands from wandering too much. Besides, it was more of a loving kiss than an all-out lusty kiss.</p>

      <p>When the necking ended, Amy pulled back and said with obvious bitterness, "How does that compare with Miss Golden Boobs?"</p>

      <p>Alan chided her, "Aims, please don't be like that. I'm telling you, what happened was a freak incident. I know I'm taking her out on these practice dates, but that's all they've been. I just want to be friends with her. Honestly! I wouldn't lie to you, not about something like this."</p>

      <p>Amy pointed out, "Yeah, but you're tempted. Way, way, super-duper tempted. Aren't you?"</p>

      <p>"Of course I am. I'm only human, and she is extremely tempting, in lots of ways. But I can't just say to her, 'Hey, come join the gang.' You know about her attitude and her sense of morality. No way would she be okay with everything that's happening in my life. If she learned the full truth, it would be like Chernobyl. Nuclear meltdown!"</p>

      <p>He was careful to be discreet, since they were outside, but Amy easily understood he was referring to the incest, as well as the overall harem-like situation.</p>

      <p>He continued, "That's why I'm keeping her at arm's length. I've made it clear to her that I'm not available. She understands, so that's why she's resisting too. I can't deny there's some sparks between us, and some flirting, and yeah, I made a mistake. But I can handle it. You have to trust me on this!"</p>

      <p>Amy pondered that for a long moment while she rested in his embrace. Then she said, "I trust that you mean well. But the fact is, you two are on a slippery slope. Maybe you don't see it, but things are gonna happen. You've crossed a line already, and things can't un-happen, y'know? That's why I kinda got all upset just now, because I know she's gonna be one of your women from now on, and I've gotta live with that."</p>

      <p>Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "But if she threatens my official-girlfriend status, I don't care who she is, or how well she fights! I'm not gonna take that lying down!"</p>

      <p>Alan kissed Amy's nose and cheeks, hoping to calm her and reassure her. "That is NOT gonna happen. Trust me. It takes two to tango. To get physically involved with her... geez, it would be like signing my own death warrant. True, she might not literally kick my ass, but then again she might. She would certainly cause a lot of trouble, and throw this amazing sexual-paradise situation we've all got into danger. I'm not stupid. I know I've been a cad, but I do have SOME self control. Like I showed with Mindy just now. And in time I'll improve. It's just that right now I'm still the kid let loose in the candy store, running wild."</p>

      <p>Amy gently kissed his lips. "Beau, I know you. You mean well; you really do. And generally speaking I do trust you. With girls like this Mindy, no problem. I wouldn't care if you'd fucked her or not, because I know she doesn't have a hold on your heart, and she never will. Heck, I'd even cheer you on with the likes of her, as long as you're careful about the whole disease-y thing."</p>

      <p>She spoke with growing emotion, almost on the verge of tears again. "I know when the dust settles and you calm down, it'll just come down to the few of us you love the most. And I love them too, so it's all good! I'm totally cool with sharing you with everyone at home, and a few more besides. It's just that... I was hoping against hope that Christine wouldn't be in the picture. But that was always a super long shot at best."</p>

      <p>"She's not! She's not!" he tried to say with determination. "Do you want me to stop my practice dates with her? Because I will, if that's what you want. Maybe that's for the best anyways, because that could be blurring the line between friendship and something more. The main thing is, I don't want you to be sad or worried. And I know your 'checking for bumps' partner has the exact same issues about Christine, so that's double the reason for me to stop those dates." (He was careful not to directly mention Katherine's name.)</p>

      <p>Amy stared into Alan's eyes for a long time. Then she leaned forward and kissed him on the nose. Smiling, she said, "Beau, that's sweet, for you to make that offer. But no, I want you to keep going on those practice dates with her."</p>

      <p>"Really? Why?"</p>

      <p>She winked enigmatically. "Just trust me on this one, m'kay?"</p>

      <p>"But why? Seriously. I was kind of thinking about canceling them already, after what happened last night."</p>

      <p>"You two... have to find your own comfort zone. Those practice dates will help speed up the process. It's better to get it over with quickly."</p>

      <p>He furrowed his brow. "You think? I don't know."</p>

      <p>"Trust me. Us girls, we know these things. Don't worry. To be honest, I really like Christine. I wanna be good friends with her, especially since she means a lot to you. I can totally roll with... whatever happens."</p>

      <p>He kissed her lips again, briefly. "Aims, you're the best! But I promise, she and I, we're headed to the friendship zone. Definitely! You have no reason to feel threatened by her. I don't care how beautiful and sexy she is. I know there's only so much of me to go around, and she can't compete with the long history I have with you and certain other people whom I can't name. Besides, it's a matter of self-preservation for me, since she simply seems incapable of understanding or accepting my unusual lifestyle. And I really want to prove to myself that I'm not a cad, and that I can control my libido at least somewhat."</p>

      <p>"Uh huh." Amy nodded. "That's good."</p>

      <p>He wrung his hands. "By the way, you know... I had sex with Simone today at school. Not that long ago, in fact. And, as you probably know already, it wasn't for the first time either. What do you think about that?"</p>

      <p>"Are you taking precautions? You know, about disease-y stuff?"</p>

      <p>"I definitely am." He briefly explained how he'd gotten her to agree to have sex only with her non-steady boyfriend plus Heather and possibly the other cheerleaders. He also mentioned how she'd agreed to be tested for STDs again.</p>

      <p>She asked, "Do you love her? Or do you think you could love her?"</p>

      <p>"No, and no. I mean, she's nice, beautiful, and a lot of fun. She's a big jokester, which I like. The race thing isn't an issue with me at all. But I'm so overextended that how am I ever going to have a chance to get to know her well, much less love her? Besides, I just don't feel a certain 'it' factor with her, and I don't get the impression that she'd want to get serious with me. Friends with benefits? Sure. That would be great. A serious lover? No. Maybe in some parallel universe where things hadn't developed with you and the others, but not in this one."</p>

      <p>Amy broke into a wide smile. "Well then, cool! As long as you're careful and stuff, then I'm totally cool with you and her getting it on from time to time. I don't worry about her like I worry about Christine, and she's not a meanie like Heather. If I were in your shoes, I'd bang her!"</p>

      <p>"Amy, you're the best. Seriously."</p>

      <p>She gave him another long, intense kiss on the lips, effectively ending the conversation.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, Amy had to return to school because she was expected to be a cheerleader at the football game, which was going to start in a matter of minutes. Alan walked with her most of the way back, then he finally got on his own bicycle and headed home in the other direction.</p>

      <p>His mood was much better, since he felt relieved to get at least that much off his chest.</p>

      <p>However, he had a nagging feeling that Amy wasn't convinced that he could avoid getting sexually involved with Christine. Deep down, he had his own doubts about it as well.</p>
