      <h2>What is this story?</h2>

      <p>Six Times a Day is not your usual erotic story. If you like arousing stories that have plot and character development too, you don't want to miss it. At over 3.25 million words, it's one of the longest erotic stories ever written. There's no other story quite like it, because it's illustrated with over twenty-seven hundred pictures, all made by the author in Japanese anime style to perfectly fit the story's scenes.</p>

      <p>The story follows Alan Plummer, quite possibly the world's luckiest male high-school student. His mother's best friend secretly lusts after him, so arranges for him to be prescribed a questionable treatment regime for a diagnosed medical problem, requiring him to have six orgasms a day, each preceded by prolonged arousal. Things don't go quite as she planned, and an increasing number of gorgeous women find themselves helping him with his "medical treatments." There's apparent 'incest' with his adoptive mother and sister, creating tense and exciting situations. There are many fully-developed female characters here (in more ways than one!) that you'll want to get to know better.</p>

      <p>It takes some time at the start of the story to develop the characters and plot, but the payoff later is a story that's emotionally satisfying as well as very arousing. There's also humor, romance, and deeper themes. The plot naturally appeals to men, but many women and couples have enjoyed it too. It's been a huge labor of love, not only for the author but also for the many fans who have helped with suggestions, proofreading, and extensive editing. The time and effort put into it shows.</p>

      <p>And if that isn't enough, the whole story is entirely free. So give it a try and allow yourself to be immersed in a fantastic erotic world. Then please leave your thoughts at the related forum for the author and others to see. Feedback is very literally the author's only reward, and comments there have often impacted the story as it continues to progress.</p>

      <h2>The structure of Six Times a Day</h2>

      <p>This epic story is divided in various ways, hopefully making it easier to read. Omitting the five support files (of which this is one), this story currently consists of 119 parts, each of which contains between 19,500 and 40,000 words of story text. It has been found that smaller parts are more managable for the reader, so many parts have been split in two. That is why some parts have "A" or "B" suffixes to their names.</p>

      <p>Each part is, by itself, the size of a typical novella. If it were printed as a paperback pocketbook, each single part would fill 50 to 100 pages of text, and more when the many illustrations are included.</p>

      <p>Each part has a title that is the name of a classic rock song, chosen to match the part's thematic content. Each song was popular before the time in 2002 when the story takes place.</p>

      <p>Each part is partitioned into between seven and seventeen chapters, each usually between 1000 and 4000 words, and each with one or more illustrations.</p>

      <p>The goal has been for each part to average one illustration per 1000 words, but the current average is closer to one illustration per 1275 words. For more on how the illustrations were made, click the Artwork link at the top or bottom of this page.</p>

      <p>In prior versions of this story, most of the illustrations for parts 64 and earlier were grayscale, but they have now been converted to color, mostly through the effort of longtime-reader YamiBoy, to whom we are all grateful.</p>


      <h2>Bra sizing in Six Times a Day</h2>

      <p>Bra cup sizes in this story use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement#Cup_sizes_vary">this</a> US scheme. Those currently used herein are B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and J. Band sizes are in inches.</p>
