      <h2 id="chapter_1">CHAPTER 1 (Thursday, Oct. 31)</h2>

      <p>Early in the morning, just before sunrise, Susan lay in bed having an erotic dream about Alan. Such dreams had become very commonplace during the past couple of weeks, pretty much from the first medical appointment with Akami. She didn't remember her dreams every night, but when she did it seemed that they were always erotic ones about Alan.</p>

      <p>This dream was different than most though, because Ron was involved and because at first she had no clue that she was dreaming. The dream began with the feeling of waking up in bed, exactly as she would have done normally.</p>

      <p>In her dream, she woke to a knock on her bedroom door, then heard Alan's voice through the door. "Mom? Are you up? It's me."</p>

      <p>This was extremely unusual. Alan hadn't knocked on her door in the middle of the night since he was about five, when he sometimes needed comforting after waking from a bad nightmare.</p>

      <p>Susan looked over and saw Ron lying next to her, on his side of their big bed, snoring gently. She said just loudly enough for Alan to hear, but hopefully not loudly enough to wake Ron, "I am now."</p>

      <p>"Can I come in?"</p>

      <p>"I suppose." The annoyance in her voice was obvious.</p>

      <p>Alan opened the door. He was wearing baggy pajamas, which in her dream did not strike her as unusual. He closed the door behind him and walked up next to Susan while keeping the light turned off. He whispered, "Sorry Mom, for waking you, but I just had to. I'm so afraid! I had the most terrible nightmare!"</p>

      <p>Susan felt a strange sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Indeed, it had been over a dozen years since this had happened last, and yet in another way it seemed as if it had been just yesterday. Back then, when he was a toddler and woke up from a bad nightmare, he would rush into his parents' room and jump right into the space between them. Once he felt safe, he would settle down and go to sleep. Even back then, Ron was traveling more often than not, which meant that usually only Susan was there to comfort him. Katherine did the same thing, and sometimes they would have nightmares on the same night, for instance after both had watched a scary TV show or there was a nighttime thunderstorm. Oftentimes, the three of them would end up sleeping together - not close enough to touch intimately, but close enough to each other to feel safe.</p>

      <p>As the dreaming Susan recalled those memories, she realized just how much she missed those years. Back then, she felt free to hug and kiss her children many times during the course of the day, and they would frequently say "I love you, Mommy!" and run to her for hugs. She didn't know when she'd stopped encouraging the physical affection, but even casual hugs had ceased almost completely by the time they reached junior high. Thinking about that loss made her feel very sad.</p>

      <p>So, in a powerfully nostalgic mood, she looked up at Alan's silhouette as he stood there in the darkness and said, "That's okay. What can I do to help?"</p>

      <p>He looked shy and embarrassed as he said, "I know this sounds silly, but can I get in bed between you and Father until I get rid of these jitters? I'm totally freaked out!"</p>

      <p>She smiled. "You're a bit bigger than last time, but sure. Hop in." Technically, Susan and Ron slept in separate beds, but the beds were flush together. One large bedspread covered them both, but beneath that each bed had its own sheets and blankets. Susan pulled down the sheets on her side of the crack between the two beds, inviting Alan to lie there.</p>

      <p>He immediately took up the invitation, but not before pulling off his pajama top and bottoms and dropping them on the floor. Suddenly, a hard and insistent erection loomed into view.</p>

      <p>Just as suddenly, Susan started to think that allowing him into her bed was a very bad idea. As he gently and quietly scrambled up the middle of the two beds, she exclaimed in a loud whisper, "Tiger! Why are you taking your pajamas off?!"</p>

      <p>"Sorry, Mom, but that's how I sleep now. I can't sleep in pajamas anymore. There's just no way." As he talked, he ducked under the covers and lay down right next to her.</p>

      <p>"But Son! I thought you said you were scared!" She didn't want to admit it, even to herself, but her nipples quickly grew erect and her pussy tingled with arousal.</p>

      <p>"I am! Terrified! Thank God you're here." He scooted up closer to her in the bed, his front side cuddling right up to her front side. That put his bare chest right up to her unavoidable large breasts.</p>

      <p>She was so shocked that she froze in place. She wished she were facing the other way, but it would be rude to turn over now. She was thankful at least that she was wearing her nightgown, but in some ways that was worse because it was made of satin and the feel of her son rubbing against her silky curves felt even more delightful than if it was skin to skin.</p>

      <p>She held her breath for a long time, fearful of what he might do next. But he finally seemed to settle down, and then stopped moving altogether. She exhaled with relief.</p>

      <p>She considered the situation, and decided that all in all it wasn't that terrible. True, he was naked and her nipples were pressed into his chest. She hoped that her nightgown was thick enough to disguise from him just how erect her nipples were - she blamed that on the excitement of an unusual situation. But aside from that, their bodies weren't touching much except for some incidental leg contact. He seemed to go out of his way to bend his torso in such a way that his erection wouldn't poke into her.</p>

      <p>She whispered, "Tiger, you're not five years old anymore, you know. It's not exactly appropriate for a boy your age to lay here like you are, especially without your pajamas. What would your father think?"</p>

      <p>He whispered back, "I know, Mom, I'm sorry. But in the nightmare there were burglars breaking into the house and it was all so real and scary!"</p>

      <p>"Well, that does sound pretty terrible. But you can only stay here for a little while, until you calm down, okay? Then it's right back to your bed. If your father were to wake up right now and see this, he'd have a hissy fit!" Her voice dropped lower. "I can't even imagine what he'd think."</p>

      <p>"Okay, Mom. Sorry."</p>

      <p>In her dream, both of them briefly looked at Ron, with Alan twisting his neck around to do so. Though the room was dark, they could see Ron's chest rising up and down under his covers and hear a steady snoring. Clearly, he was sound asleep.</p>

      <p>Since Alan was partly turned the other way, Susan attempted to scoot away from him while he was distracted.</p>

      <p>But the move backfired. He ended up scooting in closer as he readjusted, and now she was at the edge of the bed and didn't have any more room to move away again. He said, "Don't worry; it'll be all right. I won't be long. In fact, I feel better already. But do you remember how you'd comfort me when I was really small?"</p>

      <p>"Alan!" Susan nearly shouted. Had it not been for Ron being right there, she most certainly would have shouted, because her nightgown had a tie right over her cleavage and, while he was talking, he had found it and untied it.</p>

      <img id="susan425c" class="center altImg" src="part13a/susan425c.jpg" title="susan425c" alt="G: Alan squeezing Susan's breasts, starting to suckle on her left nipple" />

      <p>Acting fast, he pulled the front of her nightgown open, exposing her big breasts, and then dropped his head down to her bountiful charms. His mouth latched onto her left nipple and he started to suckle.</p>

      <p>She exclaimed, in an urgent but much quieter voice, "Son, just what do you think you're doing?!"</p>

      <p>He was too intent on suckling to answer.</p>

      <p>So, after a brief pause, she continued, "How can you remember that? I stopped nursing you before you were two!" (In reality, she hadn't nursed him at all. But in her dream world she had, and in fact in that world he wasn't adopted at all.)</p>

      <p>He still didn't answer. He just contentedly suckled like a newborn babe.</p>

      <p>She fidgeted about. She even tried briefly to push him away, but her heart wasn't in it. She felt something primal about having him suckle at her breast, and she just couldn't deny him that.</p>

      <p>Milk soon began to flow, which would have been a miracle in reality but seemed normal and even expected in the dream.</p>

      <p>Susan knew that, as a faithful wife and responsible mother, she had to do or say something. But her nipples were her greatest weakness - any fondling of them, or of her breasts in general, rapidly got her hot. Within seconds of him starting to suckle on them, she felt a lusty heat rising within her. There seemed to be a direct line between her nipples and her clit and pussy. The more his lips nursed at her breasts, the more she started to leak down below.</p>

      <p>Soon the room was fragrant with the musky smell of her arousal. Her big breasts rose up and down with Alan's face on them like a ship riding the ocean waves. She felt a deep contentment as the milk flowed into her son's mouth. She absolutely loved being a mother, and this was the height of motherly happiness for her.</p>

      <p>After a couple of minutes, he switched to the right nipple even though he hadn't exhausted all the milk from the left one. As he did so, he kept a supporting hand on her left breast. It soon became a fondling hand. He lightly twisted and pulled her free nipple. Then his hand holding her other pillowy globe started to do more than just hold it.</p>

      <p>Susan had been quiet, afraid of even whispering for fear of waking her husband. But now she said in a nearly inaudible voice, "Tiger, you can't do that! You're, you're... feeling me up! That's too sexual! What if your father wakes up?! This could cause soooo much trouble. Think about it!"</p>

      <p>Alan still didn't answer. Instead he just kept suckling and playing with her breasts. In fact, both his hands were wandering and exploring all over her upper body. Then he scooted in closer, causing his now throbbing erection to press up against one of her thighs.</p>

      <p>She quietly gasped as she felt the hot shaft of flesh against her cool skin. A few minutes earlier, it would have pressed against her nightgown, but as his hands wandered they had a curious habit of pulling on her nightgown and exposing more and more of her voluptuous body. Now the nightgown was bunched uselessly around her waist.</p>

      <p><em>Oh God! It's happening again!</em> she thought with growing alarm (and arousal). <em>He's gonna get me naked, and then he's gonna make me suck his cock! But what's terrible is he's gonna make me love it too! Dear Lord, please, give me strength to resist! This is so terribly wrong. I can hear Ron breathing!</em></p>

      <p>But even that wasn't enough for him. He continued to undo the nightgown until it was open from top to bottom, and then he pulled it out from under her and tossed it onto the floor. Then he cuddled in closer with his head near hers instead of at her chest. That allowed him to actually rest his erection directly over her bush, clit, and slit.</p>

      <p><em>Good Lord, I'm totally naked now! I should have resisted more, but I'm too hooooorny! His cock is resting on me and it feels sooo good!</em> She reflexively cuddled back and found herself gripping one of his ass cheeks. But when she realized what she was doing, she let go. "Alan!" she hissed, "have you gone mad?!"</p>

      <p>He finally pulled away to speak. He wiped off the milk dribbling down his chin, looked into her eyes lovingly, and said, "No, Mom. It's just that you're so beautiful, I can't resist looking at your breathtakingly beautiful body."</p>

      <p>She griped, "Well, if you're gonna suckle, then suckle. But please, do it fast!" She said that mainly so he'd have to scoot back down. She couldn't bear to have him keep his boner rubbing against her clit - it was driving her crazy. She also didn't want him to notice how her cunt was leaking like a broken faucet.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_2">CHAPTER 2</h2>

      <p>Alan pulled down the sheets and blankets on Susan's half of the double bed until they lay in a useless heap around their feet and ankles. Then he went right back to fondling and suckling on her breasts. That put his erection back between her thighs, which at least was too low for fucking.</p>

      <p>Both of them had completely forgotten about his nightmare, if indeed he'd ever had one.</p>

      <img id="susan315c" class="center altImg" src="part13a/susan315c.jpg" title="susan315c" alt="G: Susan lying naked in her bed, head on pillow, while Alan looms over her, fondling her breasts" />

      <p>Susan knew she should be mad, but she couldn't stop smiling. She looked down at her exposed nudity, then at her son's big hard-on poking into her inner thigh, then finally over to Ron where he was still blissfully snoring away. She was so turned on that she wanted to scream for joy. She knew what her son was doing to her was wrong, horribly wrong, but it felt so fantastic that she was completely helpless to stop it. The fear that her husband could wake up and discover her at any second made it all that much more deliciously sinful and exciting.</p>

      <p>She thought, <em>I've never felt so alive! My son is such a MAN! He just takes what he wants, and right now what he wants is his busty mommy! He doesn't care that Ron is right here; he knows that Mommy is slave to his cock anytime, anywhere! Besides, Ron cheated on me, so why should I care about what he thinks? Isn't it time that I start to live for myself? And that means serving my son and his wonderful cock! MMMM!</em></p>

      <p><em>But still, it's so cruel to do this while Ron is still here. If the tables were turned, I would just die. I really have to stop this! I need to somehow lure my studly and virile son out of the room.</em></p>

      <p>She grabbed his erection and began stroking it. She whispered huskily, "Tiger, I'll bet all that suckling and playing with your mommy's big titties has made you nice and hard. I'll bet your balls could use a thorough draining."</p>

      <p>He just murmured as he suckled, "Mmmm-hmmm."</p>

      <p>She raised her head briefly to make sure Ron's eyes were still closed. Comforted by his continued light snoring, she said quietly as she pumped Alan's shaft, "Mommy loves jacking you off. Your cock is hot and alive in my hands! But I would love it even more if I could give your big, thick sperm-filled meat a nice suck. Mmmm! Mommy can't wait to get all those pulsing hot inches of cock-meat into her mouth! But not here! It would be too noisy and messy. Let's go to your room right now and have lots of fun. How does that sound?"</p>

      <p>He disengaged. "Great, Mom." But instead of making a move off the bed, he straddled her and then climbed up her body until his long, stiff dick was dangling right over her mouth.</p>

      <p>She hissed with renewed fear, "No, baby! Not here! I said 'in your room'!"</p>

      <p>But he seemed not to hear her. "Come on. You said you want to suck it, so suck it!"</p>

      <p>Aroused beyond comprehension, she finally gave up all resistance. Her mouth had been firmly shut, but then he started to tickle her underarms. She opened her mouth to protest and laugh, but somehow it just stayed open, and even opened wider and wider as his erection drew closer to her red lips. She remained motionless, but let him feed inch after inch of hot cock into her mouth.</p>

      <p>Normally when Alan got a blowjob, he was so happy that he was content to just stand there and enjoy the terrific erotic pleasure coursing through his body. But this dream Alan was much more aggressive than the real world Alan. Kneeling over her, he began thrusting his hips vigorously, effectively fucking her face. Meanwhile, he steadied himself by grasping her shoulders, somehow managing to caress and massage them despite his increasingly wild thrusting.</p>

      <p>Susan was humiliated, but even more aroused than before. She didn't know whether, technically, she was climaxing or not, but every passing second she felt better than she had during her best orgasms, and the waves of pleasure simply never ended. Her son kept fucking her face minute after minute after minute like an unstoppable fucking machine.</p>

      <p><em>My God! I love it! My son is fucking my face in my marital bed with my husband sleeping right next to me, and I love all of it! It's so wrong. I'm going to go to Hell for this, but I don't care! Mmmm! I just hope Ron doesn't wake up, but Tiger is shaking the bed so violently and I'm moaning so loudly, how could anyone sleep through this?! It's just a matter of time now before Ron discovers everything! Then he'll know; he'll know that I've been completely tamed by my son's cock! Mmmm! Mommy's just a naked, big-titted, cocksucking son-slut, Ron! Sorry 'bout that! Hee-hee! I'm evil! Pure evil! But I just can't resist these eight inches of sinful bliss! Eight? Heck, it has to be ten inches long, at the very least! MMMM! SO GOOD!</em></p>

      <p>By now, Alan was practically standing on the bed, shaking it so much that it rocked back and forth like a major earthquake was hitting the room. And Susan was completely unrestrained in her moaning. Had it not been that her mouth was stuffed full of juicy thick cock, she would have been screaming to the heavens.</p>

      <img id="susan312c" class="center" src="part13a/susan312c.jpg" title="susan312c" alt="B: Susan naked on her back in her bed with her legs drawn up, with Alan between them feeding his cock into her mouth, holding her head in place with his hands" />

      <p>She hadn't looked Ron's way for a long time for fear of what she might see there, plus she couldn't turn her head, given the way that Alan was rhythmically and deeply plunging his cock in and out of her mouth. (She had no gag reflex in her dream, so his entire boner magically fit into her mouth with each pass.)</p>

      <p>As if that wasn't enough stimulation for Alan, her index finger had found his anus and she was plunging it in and out in time to her imagined deep throating. She'd done it once to him in real life in one of her more uninhibited moments. In the dream, she didn't need to worry about first lubing her finger.</p>

      <p>But she finally looked over to Ron out of the corner of one eye, fully expecting to see him sitting up, crying and horrified. To her surprise, he was awake, but he wasn't paying her or Alan the slightest attention. Instead, he was on top of a slim, petite Thai woman, rutting into that woman just as intently as Alan was fucking her own face.</p>

      <p>Susan was shocked and appalled. Despite her own actions, she felt a great anger burning inside. Jealous and humiliated, she started flailing her arms about, to no avail. As she began pounding on Alan, trying to get him to stop, she felt the dream slipping away. Only then did she realize that in fact it was a dream.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, there she was, in her own bed, wide awake with her heart pounding wildly. There was no sign of Alan anywhere, and she was still wearing her nightgown. Needless to say, Ron was asleep and there wasn't any Thai woman to be seen. Her labia certainly were wet though, and her breathing was very ragged.</p>

      <p>She sat up in the darkness. <em>A dream! Only a dream! Thank the Lord! Praise Jesus! Oh my God!</em></p>

      <p>She just sat there for a few minutes, recovering.</p>

      <p>Eventually, she calmed down enough to begin thinking seriously about the dream. <em>That was the most disturbing nightmare of my life! True, it was unbelievably arousing. It was like one endless multiple orgasm. But it was SO WRONG! If nothing else, there are all the horrifying Oedipal implications of Tiger just TAKING me like that while Ron was sleeping next to us! I don't even want to think about it. Ron must never know! Never, ever, ever! Tiger must never know either! Even Suzanne can't know. I can't tell anyone; it will have to be my secret shame.</em></p>

      <p><em>Oh my God! What if Tiger found out about it, and decided to try it out in real life? That would be SO HOT! But so wrong! Really, really wrong! I can't even go there in my fantasies.</em></p>

      <p><em>But boy would it be hot. ... And wrong. I can't forget the wrong part!</em></p>

      <p>After an hour or more of tossing and turning, she finally went back to sleep.</p>

      <p>When she woke, she went through her morning routine in a daze until after Ron and both kids had all left the house. She felt like everyone could read her mind, but of course they all remained completely unaware of what was bothering her, though it was quite apparent to each of them that something had happened.</p>

      <p>Ron guessed it was a nightmare, since she'd gone to sleep perfectly happy and then awoke next to him quite agitated. But he didn't ask her about it before he hurried off to his office.</p>

      <p>As usual, shortly after the others had gone, Suzanne came over to join Susan for their morning exercises.</p>

      <p>Susan's resolve not to tell Suzanne about the dream lasted at most five minutes. Suzanne occasionally kept secrets from Susan, but Susan was pretty much incapable of keeping any secrets from Suzanne, and this was no exception.</p>

      <p>As soon as Suzanne walked through the door, Susan rushed up to her and began crying in her arms. She bawled so passionately and for so long that she had no choice but to explain to Suzanne what had set her off. Other people could have lied their way out of it or made up some feeble excuse, but Susan was too honest and relied upon Suzanne's help and guidance too much to do that. She blurted out the entire dream as best she could recall it, crying the entire time. She was so distraught, she didn't even get very aroused while retelling it.</p>

      <p>She felt a lot better after unloading her burden. She felt even better after Suzanne began to interpret the dream for her.</p>

      <p>Suzanne said, "Susan, that is a pretty weird dream, I have to admit. But it's just a dream! Just a dream! People dream all kinds of strange things, and it means nothing. Frankly, I'm not surprised in the least."</p>

      <p>"You're not? You don't think I'm some kind of horrible, sinful freak?"</p>

      <p>Suzanne laughed. "Hardly. I think you're a lovely, loving person. No, what I mean is, the medical help you've been giving Sweetie has been weighing heavily on your mind. You've been forced to think about your rather unusual treatment of him quite a lot. At the same time, Ron's been home here and you were hit with this huge bombshell about him cheating on you. It's only natural that with these two things dominating your thinking, you'd have a dream that encompassed both. If you, say, were mugged at gunpoint and then had a grandmother die a couple of days later, don't you think you'd have dreams about one or the other event, and sometimes both?"</p>

      <p>"Probably," Susan admitted, nervously twirling her thumbs.</p>

      <p>"Of course you would! For days and days and days. You might dream about your grandmother getting shot during a mugging or something like that. That's how the mind works. There are absolutely NO disturbing Freudian or Oedipal implications to this dream. None whatsoever. It's just pure coincidence to have dreams about Alan's treatment and Ron's cheating intersect in that kind of story."</p>

      <p>"Really?!"</p>

      <p>"Absolutely! Now, obviously, I wouldn't go and tell Ron or Sweetie about it. You're wise not to do that. Sometimes people misunderstand things like that, and not a lot of people have taken a class on dreams in college like I did. But I tell you honestly, put it completely out of your mind because it has no meaning whatsoever. Changing the subject, I've heard that Macy's is having a big sale today. I say we go there right now and check it out!"</p>

      <p>"But what about our exercises?"</p>

      <p>"We'll do those later. If we go now, we'll avoid the crowds." Suzanne knew Susan often ruminated during her exercises, but a shopping trip would distract her more and help her forget the dream faster.</p>

      <p>It took some time and effort, but Suzanne eventually managed to get Susan to forget almost completely about her dream. In fact, as the day went on, the details of the dream grew increasingly fuzzy, the way dreams usually do. Within hours, Susan could only remember a hazy outline, because Suzanne kept her so distracted that she didn't have any time to reflect on and reprocess the dream. By the time they returned home, Suzanne's recall of the dream was better than Susan's, due to the way memories of dreams fade unless one actively records the dream upon awakening.</p>

      <p>However, Susan felt a lingering sense of guilt and unease that not even Suzanne's efforts could dissipate. The details of the dream were gone, but the emotional impact was still there.</p>

      <p>Susan vowed to herself to avoid all sexual contact with Alan, at least for the next few days until she could get her head together. But at the same time, she knew she'd also forbidden Suzanne from doing anything with Alan, as punishment for the pool incident the previous day. She'd already made an exception for that the night before, and any further exceptions would make the whole punishment pretty much worthless. She also was dead set against Alan committing the "sin of Onan." She'd actually let him do that the night before, because she figured that was less of a sin than helping him out with Ron down the hall.</p>

      <p>But Alan still had to cum six times a day. Susan had no idea how to cope with that fact.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_3">CHAPTER 3</h2>

      <p>When Alan got to his first period class, he was feeling on top of the world. Even though nothing special had happened at home before going to school, he'd had such great sexual success in general lately that he felt like he was flying instead of walking. His joy made him playful, so when he saw that he was a couple of minutes early, he decided to play a little trick on Christine. Instead of entering the classroom through the usual door at the front of the room, he entered through a second door at the back of the room. Then he snuck up from behind to where Christine was sitting.</p>

      <p>He was in luck, because Christine had gotten there just before he did, and she was bending over to put her backpack on the ground. Unusually, she was wearing a skirt. True, the skirt went all the way down to her knees, but by her standards that was quite revealing.</p>

      <p>Feigning a different, gruff voice, Alan spoke to her while standing just behind her, out of her sight, so she wouldn't be able to see who was speaking. "Hey, babe, nice ass! You look as good from behind as you do from the front!"</p>

      <img id="christine177c" class="center" src="part13a/christine177c.jpg" title="christine177c" alt="Christine" />

      <p>Christine straightened up and turned around slowly, prepared to blast whoever it was with a withering look of total disdain. She started to say, "I wonder how much trouble I'm gonna get into when I rip your eyeballs from your face!" But just as she finished saying that, her eyes made contact and she realized who she was speaking to.</p>

      <p>She immediately broke into a big smile. "Oh, hi, Alan! I didn't see you come in." But then she frowned and followed up with, "What's this B.S. about 'nice ass'? When I heard that I thought you were just some asshole."</p>

      <p>He joked, "No, I'm an asshole with a name. And this is a building of facts, and learning, and truth."</p>

      <p>"So?" Her eyes narrowed, because she suspected another joke was coming.</p>

      <p>"So... I cannot tell a lie. And the shocking truth is that you do have a very nice ass."</p>

      <p>Christine immediately blushed, and quickly sat down in her seat, seemingly to better hide her rear from wandering eyes. Yet she sat facing toward the back of the class so she could keep talking to him face to face. She shot him an evil look, hissing, "Hush!"</p>

      <p>He hadn't planned on saying anything more about her ass, other than his initial surprise comment. The truth was, he really hadn't been able to see much of her ass while she was bending over, due to her long skirt. But he felt that he was on a roll. He could tell somehow that, even though on the surface Christine seemed bothered by his comment, on a deeper level she actually enjoyed it. So he quieted his voice so the other students wandering into class wouldn't overhear him, then said, "How can I be quiet when I'm in the presence of such posterial greatness?"</p>

      <p>She couldn't help but grin a little at that, despite her great discomfort at being complimented about her body. "Posterial is not a word."</p>

      <p>"Good point. How 'bout 'patootie beauty' instead?"</p>

      <p>She rolled her eyes. "No."</p>

      <p>"Okay. Number one bum?"</p>

      <p>"No, and that doesn't even quite rhyme." She looked around nervously, double checking that no one else was paying attention.</p>

      <p>"Hey, cut me some slack. I'm thinking off the top of my, well... you know what."<br /></p>

      <p>She still couldn't help but smile, even as her face reddened some more with all the continued ass talk. "Change the topic already, please!"</p>

      <p>"Okay, fine." He leaned in and spoke in a conspiratorial whisper. "Did you hear the big news? It's all over school already!"</p>

      <p>Christine leaned towards him eagerly. She was always keen to hear the latest gossip.</p>

      <p>He looked all around like a nervous spy before continuing, "The word is, this really sexy fox named Christine was caught bending over in a skirt just before school, and it turns out she gets an A plus in the Mighty Fine Behind class. She's in the ADVANCED track on that too!"</p>

      <p>Christine was fit to be tied. She shook a fist at him and growled. "GRRR! Stop it, already! You're embarrassing me!" She added with amused chagrin, "I think my first instinct, which was to poke your eyes out, was the right one. What am I going to do with you? Or should that be to you?"</p>

      <p>"I can think of some fun things." He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively, clearly still joking.</p>

      <p>She turned around in her chair and looked pointedly at the clock on the wall, hoping for class to start already. She muttered at him, "Take a chill pill. Geez! Do I have to blast you with a fire hose?"</p>

      <p>He considered making a joke about blasting her with his fire hose, but with Christine he knew not to take his sexual comments too far. So instead he just said, "Hmmm. Sounds kinky!"</p>

      <p>"GRRR!"</p>

      <p>He was rolling with the punches, sensing that Christine was actually greatly enjoying the compliments and sexy joking, even if she didn't fully realize it herself. But he wanted to be sure he wasn't offending her in some way. So he put a hand on her shoulder, forcing her to turn back to him. He said in a friendly voice, "Hey, we're just having fun, right? Back when I wanted to date you, we couldn't talk like this. But now that we're just friends, we can tease more freely, right?"</p>

      <p>"I guess." She honestly didn't know what to say. She didn't like his sexual jokes, but at the same time she didn't want him to stop. It also frustrated her that she seemed incapable of joking back when the subject was sexual.</p>

      <p>He withdrew his hand, but continued talking while staring intently into her eyes, "You need to loosen up. Fight fire with fire. When I talk like that, you should get all sassy and say something like, 'Damn straight I've got a fine ass! Too bad you're never gonna get to touch it!'"</p>

      <p>Christine raised her hands and waved them in frustration. "Come on; that's not me. I'm not good at that kind of thing." She looked around again nervously, feeling relieved when she saw that other students entering the classroom were ignoring them. After all, it was very common for the two of them to talk before and after class.</p>

      <p>Alan said with a sly grin, "Hey, it's not like you're a shrinking violet. I feel lucky I still have both my eyes. And that's a good thing, because otherwise I wouldn't get to admire your prize-winning rear end. It's so great, it ought to win the Nobel 'Piece' Prize." He made air quotes as he said “Piece” to make sure she caught the play on words.</p>

      <p>She snorted with amusement at the absurdity of all that, then quickly covered her mouth with embarrassment at being outed for laughing when she was supposedly disapproving of his comments. She growled menacingly, "Alan, you're soooo dead! I swear, you better enjoy this class because it'll be your last!"</p>

      <p>Just then the bell rang, marking the beginning of their class. Christine turned away from him, toward their teacher, indicating that the conversation was over.</p>

      <p>Alan sat back in his seat, still pleased with himself. He wasn't worried about her threats, since that was just one part of their special way of communicating with each other. <em>Geez, man! What's gotten into me? I'm acting so aggressive towards her. I never used to talk to her like that. Or anybody else, for that matter. I guess I've had so much sexual success lately that my confidence is sky high. I'm also a much more sexual guy these days. When I see a nice ass, I'm gonna revel in appreciating it, darn it. And even though I couldn't see more than the outline through her long skirt, I know she's got a really nice one.</em></p>

      <p><em>But what I really like is that she complains about it but obviously loves it! She knows I'm a horn dog, but she also knows I'm sincere. And even though it makes her squirm and blush, the fact that she couldn't stop smiling shows that she likes hearing that she's beautiful. Heck, what woman doesn't?</em></p>

      <p><em>In fact, now that I think about it, it's pretty dang cool what happened when I got here. I pretended to be someone else making a crude comment, and she got all pissed, but as soon as she realized that it was me her attitude changed in an instant. The fact is, nobody else could talk to her like that without her getting all pissed off. We've got a special thing going on, which is really great. Besides, teasing her about her ass today was soooooo much fun! I love that I'm not letting my shyness stop me anymore.</em></p>

      <p>As Alan was thinking that, Christine was busy thinking too. <em>That Alan! Jesus, he really knows how to piss me off! I swear, I should just smack him upside the head one of these days. Although... how could I not laugh at some of those names? "Posterial greatness." "Mighty Fine Behind class."  And it looks like I'm going to win the Nobel 'Piece' Prize in "assiness," or something.</em> She chuckled inwardly.</p>

      <p>She smiled widely, already fondly recalling the conversation even as her embarrassed blush was still fading. But then her smile turned to a frown as her self-consciousness about her looks came to the fore. <em>I wish I was half as sexy as he seems to think I am. Just because I have these oversized bags on my chest, he gets all moony and loses his mind, just like all the other guys.</em></p>

      <p><em>And this all happened because I decided to wear a skirt for a change. If he's gonna carry on like this, I'm not gonna wear a skirt like that again! It's back to pants for me. Although...</em></p>

      <p>A wicked grin covered her face as she considered possibilities. <em>I wonder how he'd react if I show up in an actual miniskirt? He'd probably really blow a gasket. I'd love to see the expression on his face if I were to come to class in a shockingly revealing miniskirt and then bend over with him standing right behind me! What clever quip would he come up with if I bent over enough for him to see the color of my panties? I'll bet he'd be truly speechless for once! Ha ha ha!</em></p>

      <p>But her grin disappeared as she realized, <em>Not like I would ever do that. But still, it's fun to imagine. I should do something to shock him at least a little bit. Look at what I'm wearing now. it's ridiculous! This shirt covers me to my neck, like I'm trying to be Amish. He's right: I do need to loosen up, and maybe fight fire with fire. In fact, I wonder if I should wear my red shirt to school tomorrow, the one that's really tight and shows off more than a little cleavage. He's never seen that one before. Or I could wear that brown skirt that shows off more of my legs...</em></p>

      <p>Christine had never cared much for fashion. Even though class had started and the teacher was speaking, for once Christine wasn't paying attention. She didn't consciously realize it, but Alan's ribald joking around plus his bold looks of lusty appreciation had put her in a horny mood, and she found it fun thinking about all the sexy clothes she could wear, and the reactions from him they would elicit.</p>

      <p>Eventually though, her unusual, slightly naughty mood subsided and she focused on the teacher's words with her usual laser-like intensity.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_4">CHAPTER 4</h2>

      <p>Alan and Glory were worried about spending too much time together at school. To reduce suspicion, they were trying to limit getting physical with each other to only about three times a week. They'd decided in advance that this day was one of the days for them to stay away from each other.</p>

      <p>As a result, Alan was planning to eat lunch with his friends. He didn't even stay after class to talk with Glory for a few minutes, as he often did, instead walking out into the hall with his good friend Sean.</p>

      <p>But as soon as they left the classroom, Alan was in for a shock. "Aunt Suzy! What are you doing here?!"</p>

      <img id="suzanne304c" class="center" src="part13a/suzanne304c.jpg" title="suzanne304c" alt="Suzanne in a red suit and hells, with a whiteboard in the background" />

      <p>Indeed, Suzanne was standing in front of him, waiting for him to appear. She was dressed elegantly and expensively, not because it was any special occasion but because she dressed like that almost every day. She smiled a warm smile at him and said, "Hey."</p>

      <p>Sean was floored, so much so that he nearly stumbled as he came to a stop along with Alan right in front of her. He exclaimed, "Whoa! Mrs. Pestridge!" Suzanne was showing off a very generous amount of cleavage, and Sean's eyes went straight to her deep valley. He and many others knew from parent-teacher conferences that she was Amy's (and Brad's) mother. She'd made a lasting impression on the male students of Alan's school, to put it mildly.</p>

      <p>Alan got an erection almost instantly. But then again so did Sean and every other male who saw her.</p>

      <p>Suzanne grabbed Alan's hand. "Come on. We've got something of a family crisis to discuss." She began quickly click-clicking her way down the hall with Alan in tow. The normal hustle and bustle of the students as they left their classes and headed to the cafeteria was replaced by a kind of awed hush as everyone stared at Suzanne's incredible beauty.</p>

      <p>One reason Suzanne regularly dressed so exquisitely was because she liked to draw attention to herself. But she didn't want this much attention, so she was in a rush to get away.</p>

      <p>Alan was in so much of a daze that he could barely keep up. At one point he asked her what was going on, but she didn't say anything because she was waiting until they had complete privacy.</p>

      <p>They finally reached Susan's two-seat sports car, a silver 1995 Mazda RX-7 with the Performance Enhancement Package. She got in the driver's seat and took off in a great hurry, while he sat in the passenger's seat.</p>

      <p>Alan was usually thrilled to ride in her sporty car, but at the moment he was too disturbed to enjoy it. "Okay, Aunt Suzy, what's going on? I hope you really needed to come here, 'cos I'm gonna get no end of grief from my friends about this."</p>

      <p>She asked with pretend cluelessness, "Oh? Why is that?"</p>

      <p>"You know why! It's like a famous movie actress, like Nicole Kidman or Catherine-Zeta Jones, just appeared in our school halls for no apparent reason. You look so fucking HOT! It's like all the girls were, I dunno, ice cubes in comparison."</p>

      <p>She smiled widely, then pouted winsomely and teased, "Nicole Kidman, huh? I must be losing my touch."</p>

      <p>Before he could respond to that, she said, "But there's no time. Let me be quick, because I know you only have 40 minutes for lunch. Oh, and here. Eat this." She pointed to a paper bag she'd put on the floor in front of his seat.</p>

      <p>He opened it and saw it was a bag lunch she'd made for him. Realizing they were in a big hurry for something, he immediately began unwrapping and eating the veggie-burger sandwich.</p>

      <p>Seeing him do that, she said, "Okay. Now I can answer your questions, Sweetie. I got a call from Brenda an hour or so ago. She wants to meet me in a little while. She wouldn't really say what for, as she seemed rather shy about the whole thing, but she said it was something that you highly recommended that she do. Do you know what she means?"</p>

      <p>He shook his head.</p>

      <p>"Now, here's the thing. I'm supposed to meet her before you even get home from school. I don't like to go into these things unprepared, which means I have to talk to you now, before you get home. That's why I had to see you at lunch."</p>

      <p>He said as he chewed his sandwich, "That's it? I thought it was something important, especially when you said it was a family crisis."</p>

      <p>"It IS important! And it is a family crisis of sorts. Brenda's not just some woman. That's all she was, up until she found out about the incest. Because of that, she's now very important and we have to treat her extremely carefully."</p>

      <p>"Okay. What do you want to know? And where are we going, anyways?" He'd noticed Suzanne wasn't driving to their home neighborhood. He couldn't think of any reason for her to be driving in the direction she was taking.</p>

      <p>"Let me worry about that. First, I want to know why you were so insistent that she talk to me. But more than that, I want you to tell me EVERYTHING that you two talked about last night while you had the chance to be alone."</p>

      <p>"Everything? Aunt Suzy, I can't do that. We talked about some private, personal stuff. I don't want to betray her confidences."</p>

      <p>Suzanne glanced over briefly, giving him a discouraging look. "Did you make some kind of promise not to discuss what you said with anyone else?"</p>

      <p>"No. But it was assumed."</p>

      <p>"Assumed, my ass! Sweetie, I appreciate you being considerate, but all's fair in love and war. We can't afford to mess around, not on this. Not only is Brenda a highly fuckable piece of ass that I expect you to lay claim to and royally fuck someday soon-"</p>

      <p>He interrupted, "Whoa! You're kidding me, right?"</p>

      <p>Suzanne rounded a corner at speed, squealing the tires briefly before replying, "No, I'm not. Brenda needs a man like you wouldn't believe, and if you're even half the man I know you to be, she'll be spreading her legs for you faster than you can say, 'Hi, Brenda!' But that's not what's got me picking you up in the middle of the day at school. What's got me really worried is that if you, and I, don't play our cards right, she could ruin absolutely EVERYTHING with what she knows. You didn't actually promise to not share what you two talked about. Do you really want to risk this wonderful sexy future I'm helping make a reality for you, just for some vague maybe assumption?"</p>

      <p>He exhaled with frustration. "No, I guess not."</p>

      <p>"Good."</p>

      <p>Suzanne pulled the car over and turned off the engine.</p>

      <p>Alan had been so preoccupied with talking to her while eating his sandwich that he'd lost track of where she'd been driving. He looked around and realized they were in a parking lot overlooking the beach. Her car was parked right at the top edge of a cliff, so they had a great view of the sand and the ocean, while their height and position made it very unlikely that anyone would look up and see them.</p>

      <p>Still looking around at the view, he asked, "Why are we here?"</p>

      <p>She smiled wolfishly. "I was thinking... where can we talk that's only five minutes from your school, and get cozy at the same time?" She said "get cozy" in such a sultry manner that it made him look over at her.</p>

      <p>To his amazement, she was suddenly mostly on top of him and not wearing any clothes! Her ass and legs were still in her seat, but her top half was leaning over his chest.</p>

      <p>That astounded him. He cried out, "Whoa! How did you get naked so fast?!"</p>

      <p>She took his half-eaten bag lunch and set it aside. "I picked clothes that were quick to take off. Plus, no undies helps." She kissed him on the lips while pulling down his shorts, so that by the time her passionate kiss had ended his shorts were down his thighs and her hand was sliding up and down his shaft.</p>

      <p>He gasped quietly, with genuine awe, "My God you're gorgeous!" His heart was pounding hard, more from being in close proximity to a naked Suzanne than from the danger inherent in their public location.</p>

      <p>She grinned, but otherwise ignored his compliment. She said in her sexy, scratchy voice, "I figure we've got nearly half an hour, and then it's five minutes to get you back to class on time. Do you want to just talk, or do you want to have some nasty fun with that beautiful woman that all your friends at school were gawking at and dreaming about?"</p>

      <p>He asked in confusion, "But I thought you had an urgent need to talk about Brenda?"</p>

      <p>She yanked the lever controlling his seat, causing it to slide all the way back so they'd have more leg room. Then she tilted his seat back. "I do, but later!" She kissed him again in a way that took his breath away.</p>

      <p>Alan was worried about being seen. It was true that the beach below them was mostly empty, in part because it was the middle of a school day. He was relieved that they weren't at the White Sands Beach, the one closest to his high school, where any of his classmates who cut class might see them. Also, fortunately, the back and side windows on her car were tinted as much as California law would allow.</p>

      <p>Suzanne loved the feel of skin on skin, as well as the thrill of danger, so before long she had his shorts all the way off and his T-shirt pulled up to his armpits.</p>

      <p>He could tell she was extremely hot to trot. So, in addition to running his hands all over her ass and upper body, he dared to touch her pussy, which he was excited to find was soaking wet. To his delight, she didn't say or do anything to stop him. He assumed that was probably because she was so busy with the kissing.</p>

      <p>After one particularly breathless kiss, she suddenly broke away. She looked at him with fire in her eyes. "You naughty boy! You naughty, naughty boy!" She laughed with pure joy. Her ass was still in her seat, and now she readjusted her position so her head was right over his crotch.</p>

      <p>His heart pounded even harder as he realized what was coming next.</p>

      <p>She said, "I'm going to have to punish you for that. Trying to play with my pussy - you should know better. I'm going to have to give your cock a good tongue lashing. Yes indeed!"</p>

      <p>He let out a strangled cry, because she skipped the usual step of merely licking his boner and went straight to bobbing on it.</p>

      <p>He clutched at the door handle and emergency brake to hang on. His ass rose slightly off the seat as an intense surge of pleasure coursed through his body. "Oh! MAN! Fuck me!"</p>

      <img id="suzanne302c" class="center" src="part13a/suzanne302c.jpg" title="suzanne302c" alt="B: Suzanne with a cock in her mouth, grasping the root with her left hand while her right fondles the ball sac" />

      <p>She bobbed on him for about five minutes, using a variety of styles and rhythms.</p>

      <p>He found himself thinking, <em>The Tongue comes out to play. Not just any tongue, but THE Tongue! Dang, the things she can do with that sucker! God damn! Now she's just showing off, practically wrapping it around my entire shaft! Fuuuuuuuck!</em></p>

      <p><em>Oh man! If she keeps on like this, I'm gonna blow! Like, NOW! Shit! Shit, shit, shit! Gotta hold out! I don't want her to think I can't handle it. But her tongue! Her lips! Her fingers! Just the things she's doing to my balls are driving me crazy! And the bobbing! Dear God, the BOBBING!</em></p>

      <p><em>I know! The best defense is a good offense!</em> He reached out and started playing with her nipples. He wanted to play with her pussy again, but it was out of reach.</p>

      <p>Had he been able to reach her pussy, he might have successfully distracted her and caused her to slow down. Instead, pretty much all he did was get himself worked up even more, since her huge, soft tits felt so good in his hands.</p>

      <p>The situation was getting desperate - her oral skills were fantastic and her efforts were relentless. He let go of her boobs, but that didn't help much, not in the face of her rhythmic bobbing. In desperation, he cried out, "Mercy! Uncle! Oh God! Please stop."</p>

      <p>Amused, she stopped. She pulled her lips off and switched to merely licking him for a while. This allowed her to talk again, but she couldn't help but crow a little.</p>

      <p>"So... Sweetie... Are you still bummed that I showed up unannounced at your school?" She licked her way down to his balls, slathered them in her saliva, and then went right back to the most sensitive region at his cockhead.</p>

      <p>"No! Fuck no! Jesus!" His eyes were closed and he was straining hard. His T-shirt had fallen back down most of the way, so at least he would seem clothed to someone looking in from the outside. He worried that he'd appear to be some weirdo having a powerful masturbation session, but he reminded himself that between the tinted side and back windows and the angle of the cliff in front of the car, the odds of anyone noticing him were very small indeed. As usual, Suzanne had everything figured out ahead of time.</p>

      <p>She knew almost better than he did just how much pleasure he could take without cumming. She was making repeated X patterns over his sweet spot with her tongue, finally giving him the "tongue lashing" that she'd promised earlier.</p>

      <p><em>FUCK, man!</em> he thought, gripping onto parts of the car like his life depended on it. <em>So fucking INTENSE! I swear, she's playing me like a fiddle! How does she know when to ease up just enough?! I'm so damn high on lust that I could fly!</em></p>

      <p>She said between licks, "So... What would your friends think... if they knew... that the hot MILF they saw you with... was doing THIS to you right now?!" She giggled. "Your mom likes to call herself one of your 'personal cocksuckers.' Would you like me to be another one of your personal cocksuckers? Would that turn you on?"</p>

      <p>She found herself aroused by her own words, so much that she went back to a steady bobbing right over his sweet spot. It was so pleasurable that he practically ripped the handle off the door. After just a minute or two he had to shout again, "Aunt Suzy! Please! Stop!"</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_5">CHAPTER 5</h2>

      <p>Suzanne did stop, but did so reluctantly since she was increasingly eager to guzzle down one of his creamy loads. However, she was willing to wait, since she could see that he was fighting with all his might to hold out.</p>

      <p>Realizing that he needed a longer strategic break, she crawled back up his body until she was face to face with him, which had the added benefit of letting her stretch a bit after being cramped in the limited space under her dashboard while she was between his legs.</p>

      <p>"Aaaaah! That's better!" She stretched her arms as best she could, considering she was inside a small sports car with the windows rolled up. She kissed him playfully on the nose and said, "You know what? You should move your cock to your nose. Then I could alternate between kissing you and sucking you off. That would be a lot more comfy in a small car."</p>

      <p>He said sarcastically, "I'll work on that."</p>

      <p>She tenderly ran a hand over his face. Staring at him from inches away, she said, "So, you like your ol' Aunt Suzy?"</p>

      <p>"For my own self-protection, I'm not going to answer that."</p>

      <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

      <p>"Well, I see you're still jacking me off with one hand. Just having your beautiful nude body on top of mine in a place like this is too sexy to be believed. If I answer that question honestly, I'm going to have to say that I don't just like you, I love you, and I love you so much that it almost makes me cry tears of joy. And then you're gonna get way too excited and go to town on my dick even more than you already have, and I'm gonna cum way too soon during a lunch break."</p>

      <p>His talk of love made her heart soar. She was so thrilled, and already so much in love with him, that her entire body seemed to be humming. She said playfully, "You think you've got it all figured out, don't you?"</p>

      <p>"I do." He looked at her with a mixture of triumph and love.</p>

      <p>She just stared at him for a long moment, then suddenly scrambled back down to her previous spot between his legs. "Dammit, you're right!" Once she was settled in, she gave some long licks from his balls to his pisshole and then back down, after which she said, "But you're half right and all wrong. I'm not going to blow you; I'm going to give you another titfuck! You like those too, don't you?"</p>

      <p>He groaned with a mixture of delight and dismay. "Oh God! Please! Give me strength! Aunt Suzy, if you do that, I'm gonna cum in, like, three seconds!"</p>

      <p>"Hmmm. We don't want that. We've got to maintain your treatment schedule." She had added that last statement to try to maintain the pretense that he was getting a medical treatment. She let his hot erection settle in the depths of her cleavage, but took his warning seriously and delayed starting the titfuck.</p>

      <p>He closed his eyes again and started counting.</p>

      <p>She could tell what he was doing because she saw his lips move. "Doing the old 'close your eyes and count to ten' trick, huh? Good idea." She lapped her way around his cockhead until he had to gasp out loud, then stopped. "That's an old hit from the sixties, you know. Dusty Springfield, I think." She sang:</p>

      <p class="verse">"I close my eyes and count to ten,<br />
      and when I open them you're still here<br />
      I close my eyes and count again,<br />
      I can't believe it but you're still here"</p>

      <p>He wasn't familiar with the song but he liked the melody. "Nice." Her scratchy voice made her sound like Bonnie Tyler or a female Rod Stewart. His chest was still heaving from the endless waves of pleasure, but he at least managed to open his eyes and look at the beach and the ocean.</p>

      <p>Waiting a few more moments to recover, he dared to glance briefly at Suzanne, and at his dick trapped between her huge globes. "Fuckin' A! That song must be about me. I can't believe you're still here. Hell, I can't believe you're here with me at all!"</p>

      <p>She replied, "Sweetie, let's not go down that road again right now. Beautiful women need love too, you know, and it just so happens I'm kinda fond of you." She winked. "But we need to talk about Brenda. Our time is short, especially since I've hardly gotten started on your tongue-lashing punishment."</p>

      <p>She looked down toward his cockhead and tried to reach it with her tongue. "I'm gonna whip it with my long tongue over and over again until it's red and 'bleeding' pre-cum. Maybe that'll teach you."</p>

      <p>He laughed. "Teach me what? What did I do wrong in the first place? I forget."</p>

      <p>"Me too." She tried "lashing" him, but since she couldn't reach his sweet spot, she "lashed" the top of his cockhead around his pisshole instead.</p>

      <p>When she felt him tense up, she had to stop. "Okay. Let's really talk. I promise I'll be good... for the most part." She laughed wickedly. "Now, tell me what you told Brenda."</p>

      <p>"Do you seriously expect me to be able to talk at a time like this?"</p>

      <img id="suzanne305c" class="center" src="part13a/suzanne305c.jpg" title="suzanne305c" alt="TB: An apparently topless Suzanne with her boobs held close around a cock while licking the underside of the head" />

      <p>"What? Is the view of the beach too distracting?" She swirled her tongue around his cockhead and tightened the grip of her boobs around his shaft, pushing him to the very brink of climax.</p>

      <p>"Jeeeeesus! Aaaaaiiiiiieee! DAMN!" Panting hard, he complained, "You're gonna kill me!"</p>

      <p>"True, probably, by and by. But what a way to go! So anyway, talk. Time is running out."</p>

      <p>"Aunt Suzy, you're crazy!"</p>

      <p>"Never call anyone crazy who has their teeth close to your cock." Due to the titfuck position, the best she could do was lightly scrape the top inch of his cockhead with her teeth to playfully make her point. "Anyway, the human body is very, very flexible. You may not realize it, but I'm training you. Right now, it may seem crazy to expect you to talk, but soon it'll feel odd for you to talk to me WITHOUT some beautiful woman actively sucking or at least stroking you at the same time."</p>

      <p>That was such an arousing thought that it almost took him over the edge. He managed, barely, to hold on, but it left him breathless all over again.</p>

      <p>Suzanne tried to give him more of a break, but with his hot erection trapped in her cleavage and his bulbous cockhead so close to her mouth she couldn't completely help herself. After another minute or two of keeping him right on the edge, thanks to playful little licks and tit squeezes, she crawled back up him until her mouth was back in kissing range.</p>

      <p>"There. I promise not to do anything more than jack you off a little bit." She was already stroking him steadily as she said that. "Now, tell me about Brenda. And if talking about that big-titted babe inspires you to fondle the G-cups of the naked babe resting on top of you here in this public parking lot, well, so be it. Just don't put your hand here..." She took one of his hands and brought it to her pussy lips. His fingers immediately grew wet as he unthinkingly probed an inch or so into her slit.</p>

      <p>But she concluded, "...because that would be wrong."</p>

      <p>He wasn't sure if she was teasing or serious, and frankly, neither was she. But he withdrew his hand, if only because he was overcome with stimulation and he was still trying hard to stave off his own climax.</p>

      <p>She stopped stroking his shaft, only to fondle his balls instead. "Start with why she's so keen to talk to me all of a sudden."</p>

      <p>"Well... I, uh... I told her that she was unhappy. ... And, uh... Awww, hell! I give up! How can I talk like this? Your body feels so damn good! Your mouth is literally like an inch from mine. I wanna kiss you so bad!"</p>

      <p>"Then kiss me, you fool!" she said in a challenging, sultry purr. "We still have time." She turned her head and quickly glanced at the clock on the dashboard. "Would you believe we still have fifteen minutes before we have to start back?"</p>

      <p>He was tempted, but he closed his eyes and said, "No. I'm just gonna shut out all sensory information and pretend you're not jacking me off some more, and keep cool until I've told you all about Brenda."</p>

      <p>He mentally counted to ten again, which helped a good deal. "Okay. She wants to talk to you about finding a good man, and making her life happier in general. I remembered what you'd said, about how Brenda most likely was sexually submissive, and unhappy, and some other things. I figured I could use that inside scoop to kind of tempt her so she'd desire me more."</p>

      <p>Before he could say more, Suzanne interrupted excitedly, "Brilliant! I knew it! I knew it! After she talked to you, she was so fucking horny! And even kind of in a daze. You really got under her skin. And soon you're gonna get under her panties and into her burning hot CUNT!" She immediately locked lips and kissed him with a soulful passion.</p>

      <p>He could feel beads of sweat rolling down his face, because she had him so hot in more ways than one. For once, she wasn't overtly doing anything to his hard-on, because she had brought both hands up to hold his head in place while they kissed. But his cock didn't get any respite, because her curvy, naked body was writhing on top of him and she seemed to make a point of grinding and churning her hips on his shaft.</p>

      <p>It took him a while to recover from that combined kiss and cock rubbing, and he couldn't seem to let go of her ass cheeks to save his life. But he finally managed to resume his story.</p>

      <p>After Suzanne got over her initial excitement about what he'd talked to Brenda about, she calmed down enough to let him tell the rest of his story without stimulating his cock too outrageously, more or less.</p>

      <p>When he was finally done, she looked at the clock again. "Brilliant. And we still have five more minutes to play. Sweetie, you really were brilliant. I couldn't have coached you any better if I'd been able to tell you exactly what to say through an earpiece. I'm soooo glad I was able to talk to you today, because I'll be able to build on this when I see her later. She's much further along than I'd suspected. It's fucking brilliant!"</p>

      <p>She started sliding back down his body, to get back in position between his legs. "I'm so proud of you. If we can get Brenda fully addicted to serving you and your cock, we won't have to worry about what she knows regarding the incest. Thanks to her submissiveness, she'd do and say exactly what you want in her desire to please you."</p>

      <p>Suzanne's mouth was positioned for more cocksucking, not titfucking this time. She licked all over his sweet spot as she added, "Would you like that? Would you like super busty Brenda to be your submissive toy to fuck and fondle any time you like?"</p>

      <p>He just groaned lustily.</p>

      <p>"I agree! You need a big reward. I'm going to have to give you a severe tongue lashing. I'm going to whip you with my tongue until your cock is completely soaked! Oh, wait. It already is, and mostly with my saliva!" She laughed gaily.</p>

      <p>He grunted between labored breaths, "That's exactly what you said... about my... my punishment."</p>

      <p>She laughed some more, even as she kept on stroking and licking. "I did, didn't I? Oh well, punishment, reward, or anything in between - it doesn't matter. The main thing is, I know I've gotta pleasure your incredible cock!"</p>

      <p>With that, she engulfed his cockhead and then some, and got busy bobbing with strong suction. She'd been careful up to that point, easing up or stopping altogether if she thought he was too close to eruption. But she knew they only had a few minutes left, so this time she went all out.</p>

      <p>It didn't take much. He too was aware of the time. In fact, he was more aware of it since he was facing the dashboard clock and glanced at it occasionally. She'd said it would take five minutes to drive him back to school, so he was aiming to last until then. But in the end, they still had a couple of minutes to spare when he started firing his load into her hungry mouth.</p>

      <p>She kept bobbing through his climax and for about a minute afterwards, until he was completely flaccid.</p>

      <p>She sighed happily; they both seemed content and mellow.</p>

      <p>But then she was a sudden ball of energy. In a matter of seconds, she was back in the driver's seat and fumbling to put her clothes back on. "Quick, Sweetie! Your clothes! And you only ate half your sandwich. Finish it up, and your drink too."</p>

      <p>He grabbed his shorts from the floor and started pulling them up his legs. By the time he was dressed, he was surprised to see that Suzanne was already starting the car. When she meant business, she meant business, and she didn't want him to miss even one minute of class on her account.</p>

      <p>On the ride back, she asked him, "Do you remember yesterday, when you came up with the idea that I should investigate all the girls on the cheerleading squad?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah?"</p>

      <p>"Well, I was thinking about it, and I've decided against it. The problem is, if I have investigators really start digging around, they're going to end up poking around into your life, and Angel's life, and Amy's life too. Even if they try not to, it's hard, if you all are interacting. And what if, say, some investigator takes photos of you and Angel kissing rather intimately, and puts two and two together? Then I could have a whole new set of problems on my hands!"</p>

      <p>Alan admitted, "I hadn't thought of that."</p>

      <p>Suzanne chuckled. "Yeah, well, you were a bit preoccupied at the time. If I recall, a certain crazy redhead was busy licking your Johnson."</p>

      <p>He quipped, "Yeah, I gotta tell Ginger Spice to stop doing that. It's distracting!"</p>

      <p>She chortled, "Ginger Spice?! Ha! Yeah, right."</p>

      <p>Pondering the situation more seriously, he asked, "Um... Aunt Suzy? Here's an idea. What if, instead of a full-on investigation, you just do a little background check yourself? Didn't you say you have personal experience doing that kind of thing?"</p>

      <p>"I do," she admitted. "And nowdays with the power of personal computers, it's surprisingly easy."</p>

      <p>"To be honest, the main one I'm worried about is Heather. She's scary! But knowledge is power..."</p>

      <p>Suzanne smiled. "Knowledge IS power. That's a saying that people know to be true, but they're usually too lazy to act on it. You're right. I'll see to it personally, to find out a little bit about her. And that may help you, Katherine, AND Amy from being crushed under her stiletto-booted heel."</p>

      <p>"Thanks! You're the best!" He leaned into Suzanne's seat and kissed her cheek.</p>

      <p>In the end, Alan made it back to class on time, although he did have to run from the car to the classroom door, making it by only a few seconds.</p>

      <p>The only problem with the whole lunch adventure was that Christine sat next to him in his fifth period class, so noticed his post-coital lethargy and patina of sweat. Luckily, since she saw him run in, she figured it was due to his running a good distance to get to class on time. She kept her eye on him though, forcing him to stay alert and focused for the entire class, when what he really wanted to do was fade out in a post-orgasmic nap.</p>

      <p>As he sat there pretending to listen to their teacher, he thought, <em>Dang! Aunt Suzy is fucking UNREAL! I hate to say this, because I totally love Glory and how we're spending our times together, but lunch in the car with my auntie is a notch more awesome than lunch in class with my sexy teach. And that's saying a lot! But then again, Glory and I are just starting to get to know each other in an intimate way. Aunt Suzy already knows me so well that she has a big advantage.</em></p>

      <p><em>Hell, the truth is, I couldn't take a lunch like that on a daily basis; I'd be totally useless for the rest of the day!</em></p>


      <h2 id="chapter_6">CHAPTER 6</h2>

      <p>At one-thirty, on the dot, Brenda rang the doorbell to Suzanne's house. That was the time that she had asked Brenda to arrive, because Suzanne had figured she'd need time to recover from meeting Alan and to make herself presentable. It had also given her some time to think about what she was going to say. But she also wanted Brenda gone by the time the school day ended, before Brad or Amy might come home.</p>

      <img id="suzanne303c" class="center" src="part13a/suzanne303c.jpg" title="suzanne303c" alt="Suzanne in the doorway in a tailored gray jacket and very short skirt" />

      <p>"Welcome! Come in," Suzanne said, acting the perfect hostess. She was dressed as if she were going to a formal party, since she wanted to impress.</p>

      <p>Brenda was dressed similarly, because she also wanted to impress. Her dress had a plunging neckline because she hoped she might also end up seeing Alan before she went home.</p>

      <p>After a few minutes of pleasantries, Suzanne and Brenda wound up sitting on opposite sofas in the Pestridge living room. Suzanne could tell that Brenda was too embarrassed to state the reason for the visit, and kept beating around the bush.</p>

      <p>So Suzanne said, "I got ahold of Alan during his lunch at school and asked him about what you two talked about in private last night." She deliberately worded that so that Brenda would infer that Suzanne had reached him by phone, since Brenda wouldn't know that he didn't have a cell phone. Ironically, although Susan was determined not to spoil either him or Katherine by giving them things many other kids their age had, she'd lately been spoiling him rotten in a sexual manner with her frequent blowjobs.</p>

      <p>Brenda's entire body stiffened in response to hearing that.</p>

      <p>Suzanne was quick to reassure her. "That Alan. He's such an honorable, kind-hearted kid. Naturally, he told me he couldn't share what you two had talked about, since there was a presumption of privacy. But he told me that he'd recommended I could give you some pointers on finding a new man in your life, as well as on how to cope with the post-divorce blues."</p>

      <p>Brenda relaxed when she concluded, mistakenly, that that was all that Alan had told Suzanne. She nodded. "I guess that's... true enough. I must admit, being at your house last night, I saw a family, or maybe I should call it a group of friends..."</p>

      <p>"Family is good."</p>

      <p>"A family that's extremely happy. It's not just the sexual excitement in the air, although there is that too. There's just so much love, and joy, and laughter. It made me realize by contrast how unhappy my life has been in recent years. Alan talks highly of you. He says you can solve any problem, no matter how big or small. So I guess I could use your advice. How can I change things so I can be as happy as all of you are?"</p>

      <p>Suzanne nodded, pretending that this disclosure was new to her. "Okay. I can help with that. Sure. I understand your divorce is going to be final in a few months, so you're approaching a crossroads. That's the perfect time to shake things up and start down a new road - a better road. But before I can help you figure out where you want to go, I need to know where you've been. I don't know much about you. Can you fill me in?"</p>

      <p>"Sure thing." She sat back and sighed heavily. "I have some regrets and frustrations, so telling this isn't easy. But then again, in many ways I've been incredibly lucky, so I should be grateful. For starters, because I've been married to a very wealthy man, people assume I'm some kind of gold digger who married into wealth. Not true. My parents were very wealthy, so I was born into a life of luxury."</p>

      <p>She sighed again. "Unfortunately, in many ways that's more a curse than a blessing, at least the way I was raised. You see, I was spoiled rotten. On top of that, I've been blessed with this body." She looked down at her voluptuous form. "But in some ways that's more of a curse too. You see, I got my breasts very early and they just kept on growing. By the time I was fourteen, everyone treated me like I was royalty, just because I have all this extra fatty tissue on my chest and ass. That only spoiled me even more, especially when it came to men."</p>

      <p>She looked over Suzanne's body. "I'm sure you can relate. I never had to lift a hand to do anything, because some horny guy who wanted to get into my pants was there to serve me. In a way I lucked out, because the reaction of others was SO extreme, SO over the top all the time that I got completely sick of it. Well before high school even ended, all I wanted was to be left alone. I guess we always want the things we don't have, which in my case was for people to want me for my brains rather than my body. I put my nose to the grindstone and did well in school. As a result, I ended up going to the University of California at Berkeley."</p>

      <p>Suzanne nodded. "Yeah, I heard that."</p>

      <p>"You're not surprised?"</p>

      <p>"Why should I be? Brenda, we're in the same boat. The only difference is I went to UCLA because I wanted to stay in Southern California. But I was accepted to Berkeley and quite a few other top universities as well. My story's exactly the same. Everyone loved me for my body and I wanted to be loved for my brain. Hell, we might even have ended up as classmates."</p>

      <p>Brenda nodded. "That's good. Everyone treats me exactly the same. I'm so used to it that I find it hard to switch gears when someone actually understands me. Anyway, at Berkeley, I continued my spoiled ways. Believe it or not, I have a housekeeper named Anika who has basically raised me since birth. She continued as my full-time maid all through college, and she's with me still. How many college students have their own maids? None, that's how many."</p>

      <p>"You seem bitter about it," Suzanne pointed out.</p>

      <p>"Not really. Anika is the greatest; I don't know what I'd do without her. She's so much more than a maid. But I did pay the price for being pampered, and I continue to pay it. Anyway, it wasn't long before I met a man named Quintin Ross and married him. I was only nineteen. Not long after, we had a little 'accident,' meaning I got pregnant. My one and only child Adrian was the result. Although the timing was unfortunate, Aidy is the joy of my life, so now I have no regrets that I got pregnant."</p>

      <p>She continued, "Sadly, Quintin didn't feel the same. He couldn't handle being a father at such a young age and skipped out on me. I dropped out of college and got divorced. Things were not going well. At least I had Anika and my Adrian, and I was still rolling in money. Quintin certainly was not poor, so he sort of threw a ton of money at me to try to make up for running off."</p>

      <p>Suzanne nodded in sympathy. "I know what it's like having a baby or two at a young age, believe me."</p>

      <p>"Yeah. At first I let it overwhelm me, but I eventually got back on my feet and went back to Berkeley to finish my degree. But before long I met another man and fell head over heels for him too. Bob, Bob Hunter. He's the man I'm divorcing now. Since I was hanging out with the rich students, I suppose it's not surprising that he turned out to be extremely wealthy too. I can't say I married him for his money, but then again at that point in my life I was too snobby to date anyone who wasn't rich. At least I managed to graduate this time."</p>

      <p>"What in?"</p>

      <p>"A double B.A., in History and Art History."</p>

      <p>Suzanne was pleasantly surprised, since she hadn't known that. "Oh, really? How interesting. You're going to be very popular around here. Alan loves history, and my daughter Amy is just crazy about art. She's quite a painting prodigy."</p>

      <p>"That's nice. Anyway, after graduation, Bob and I moved to Orange County, to a brand new mansion that I still live in. Anika continued to work for me, but we had a whole squad of servants helping out." She frowned. "I know this sounds insincere, but I really think there's such a thing as having too much money. Bob stayed busy with his business, but we were so wealthy that it was utterly pointless for me to work. I had too much money and too much free time. Too much help, even, which meant Anika raised Adrian as much or more than I did. I think I would have been a lot happier with a lot less. I sure don't want to be poor, but money does not equal happiness, that's for sure!"</p>

      <p>"I agree," Suzanne said. "Sure, it's good to know you won't have to live on the streets but, in my experience, rich people aren't any happier than the rest. And sometimes they're a lot less happy. It's my theory that people often get rich because they're so focused on getting ahead that family and love and health and other important things fall by the wayside."</p>

      <p>Brenda nodded. "So true! That was Bob in a nutshell. I mean, fuck! Pardon my French, but we had more money than we knew how to spend, and yet it was never enough for him. That became a big bone of contention between us. I wanted to enjoy life and have more of his time, but the opposite happened. As time went on, it's like he got more and more into his job. I think he loved the power, having lots of people to hire and fire and kiss his ass. Me? I'd been through that already due to my looks. I still have this big 'everyone leave me the hell alone!' chip on my shoulder, so the last thing that would interest me is some kind of power trip."</p>

      <p>She sighed heavily again. "I just want to be done with it, all of it. The money, the servants, the snotty friends, the superficiality of it all. I've realized that I don't like ANYBODY that I know! I don't have a single real friend, except for Anika and Aidy, my son. Everyone else is just so fucking fake! Again, sorry for cursing."</p>

      <p>"Not a fucking problem." Suzanne grinned, letting on that she didn't mind the profanity.</p>

      <p>Brenda smiled at that. "You - and by 'you' I mean the whole Plummer house gang - you're the first real people I've come across in ages. You guys don't care what rich or powerful people I know, or how much my jewelry costs, or which exclusive resort I'll be going to for my next vacation. You guys actually LIKE each other, instead of sniping and back stabbing. It's so refreshing!"</p>

      <p>Suzanne reached out and held Brenda's hand. "I've been where you are, believe me. I was lost for a long time too, looking for happiness in the wrong places. My marriage went to hell years ago, which is a story I'll have to tell you later. I thought I could fill the void with sexual affairs and parties, but all the people I met were the same type of vacuous, elitist snobs that you don't like. In fact, that's how I first met you, at one of those parties a couple of years ago!"</p>

      <p>They both had a laugh over that.</p>

      <p>Suzanne continued, "Susan's been my saving grace. She has these old-fashioned conservative values. I have a LOT of problems with some of that, especially in the religious and political areas. But some of those old values turn out to be the most important things, like family. I'm all about family these days, although I continue to be estranged from my husband and his clone, my son Brad. I guess the Plummers have become my new family, and my daughter Amy's too. But Susan helped me in other ways. For a while, I tried to get her to go to those society parties. But she complained so much it was like pulling teeth, and only ever went as a favor to me. She called those people 'a bunch of puffed-up posers.' And she was right! I'd rather have one good friend like her than a thousand fair-weather friends. People who will stick with you through thick and thin."</p>

      <p>"Exactly! Suzanne, it's like you're reading my mind."</p>

      <p>Suzanne pointed out, "That's not so surprising. We're both about the same age, and we've gone through many of the exact same things, from all the attention our big breasts and curvy figures have got us to unhappy marriages to husbands who are more interested in work and money. Susan's story is a bit different, but also broadly similar. There's no reason why you, or Susan, or I have to stumble in the dark alone; we can help each other."</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_7">CHAPTER 7</h2>

      <p>They held hands again, and Brenda firmly squeezed Suzanne's. "Thank you! Alan was so right about how I needed to talk to you one on one. And I haven't even gotten to the main reason I wanted to talk to you!"</p>

      <p>They both laughed, enjoying their new camaraderie.</p>

      <p>Suzanne pulled her hand back and said, "Let's talk about that, then. Would you like something to drink?"</p>

      <p>"Nah. This conversation is far too interesting to take a break."</p>

      <p>Suzanne smiled. "Very well. Let's talk about finding you a good man. But first, let me explain a little more about my situation today. I've come to the conclusion that the most important thing, and maybe really the only thing that matters, is love. One of the ways Susan influenced me was to make me see that materialistic and selfish desires really don't matter much. I know that sounds a bit hypocritical when I'm living in this big house. I'm not saying that stuff doesn't matter at all, but once you reach a certain point... Let's put it this way. Have you ever heard of Maslow's hierarchy of needs?"</p>

      <p>Brenda's face lit up. "I have! I love it, that you mentioned that! Wow, talking to someone about something of intellectual substance. This is such a rare treat for me. Maslow was a psychologist who said that each person first tries to fulfill his or her most basic needs, like food, water, and shelter. Once those are secure, the person moves on to higher needs, like secure employment, good health, and so on. The person keeps going up to get to still higher needs like self-actualization."</p>

      <p>"Exactly! You and I, with our basic needs more than taken care of, we can move up. A lot of wealthy people never get that, and they think the goal is to collect more and more stuff. But that's a dead end. There's always that one more thing you think you need, and you keep working yourself to death until you literally die."</p>

      <p>"So true," Brenda agreed. "You can't take it with you. I have more money than I could ever reasonably need to spend. Why couldn't Bob see that? Why couldn't he at least have found a better balance?"</p>

      <p>Suzanne nodded. "Tell me about it. It's like you're describing my husband Eric. I'm at a point where what I desire above all is love. To love and to be loved. And I've found that. Susan's a big, big part of it. And my daughter Amy. And Katherine, who's like a second daughter to me. But most important of all is Alan. I've gotta say the sexual aspect plays a big role. Had it not been for that, he'd be like a son to me, which is fantastic. But he's so much more! Brenda, I'm in love! I'm so much in love!"</p>

      <p>Brenda smiled. "That's wonderful. But isn't it kind of difficult for you? I mean, I'm sure he loves you too, but he's also sexually involved with Susan and Katherine and probably others."</p>

      <p>"Oh, definitely others," Suzanne said. "He's quite the stud."</p>

      <p>Brenda noticed more than a touch of pride in Suzanne's voice, and that puzzled her. "Doesn't that bother you?"</p>

      <p>"We're working it out. It's definitely a work in progress. We're lucky that there's just one male involved. I don't think men can share women very well. It goes back to some primal caveman instinct. But if one man has several women, that can work. That's been proven through history time and time again."</p>

      <p>"The harem pattern," Brenda suggested.</p>

      <p>"If you want to call it that. In fact, I think it has big advantages. Look at us last night. You felt the vibe. The whole Plummer house is high on happiness and love, because we're all in love with Alan, and he's in love with all of us. It's incredible! For instance, I can share the joy of being in love with Alan with Susan, my very best friend. I thought we were the very best of friends already, but it's made us even closer than before. So anyway, my point is, if you want to be happy, to be deliriously happy, you need to find love AND sexual satisfaction. Right now, you're lacking both in a big way."</p>

      <p>"I am?"</p>

      <p>"It's written on your face."</p>

      <p>"It is?"</p>

      <p>"Brenda, I'm going to be blunt. I'm going to be very blunt. You look like a woman who hasn't had a good fuck in YEARS!"</p>

      <img id="brenda160c" class="center" src="part13a/brenda160c.jpg" title="brenda160c" alt="Brenda sitting on a blue sofa in a blouse and jacket, with crossed knees clad in gray hose" />

      <p>Brenda was shocked at first, but then she burst into laughter, and Suzanne joined in. "You're right! You're so right!" After the laughter died down, she asked, "Is that really written on my face?"</p>

      <p>"Well, yes and no. It's not something any stranger would notice, but I've been seeing you and talking to you more often in recent weeks, and it seems obvious to me. I'll bet it's literally true that you haven't had sex in years, at least any good sex. Meanwhile, Bob has been having affairs left and right."</p>

      <p>"What?! How did you know that?!"</p>

      <p>"From what you told me before. He's on a power trip, you said. For people like that, sex is about power. Way back when, I'm sure he pursued you aggressively because you were the best. The most beautiful. The most endowed. Smart and rich, too. It was impossible to find a more impressive wife. Then he was happy with you for a while, because having and flaunting you was one way for him to prove his superiority over others. But people like that get bored with the status quo. Eventually, he figured out having you and some women on the side would be even more of a power trip, plus there's the thrill of the chase and the excitement of keeping a dangerous secret, and so on. Believe me, I know, because my husband Eric is a lot like your Bob, and the same kind of thing destroyed our marriage."</p>

      <p>Suzanne went on, "For a long time, I was stumped: why on Earth would a man cheat on ME? Let's not toot the false modesty horn; I'm an extremely beautiful woman, and smart, and good-hearted, and an insatiable tigress in bed, and lots of other things besides. But eventually I realized it wasn't about me. His personality made his cheating inevitable. Some people are just never satisfied."</p>

      <p>Brenda asked, "Why didn't you just divorce his ass years ago?"</p>

      <p>Now it was Suzanne's turn to sigh heavily. "In retrospect, I should have. Dumbest mistake I ever made. But I thought it was vital to keep the family together until the kids graduated from high school. What I didn't realize was that a family split in two living in the same house was no favor to the kids. In fact, just the opposite. But now it's a moot point. Somehow we staggered through, and now the kids are of age and I can finally get a divorce. So you can see how very similar our situations are."</p>

      <p>"But how is Eric cheating on you different from Alan having multiple lovers?"</p>

      <p>Suzanne's eyes narrowed, and she had to control a surge of anger. "It's totally different! Nothing could be MORE different! Cheating is cheating, and it's just about the most painful kind of personal treachery you can imagine. But you probably can imagine it, since Bob cheated on you."</p>

      <p>Brenda nodded.</p>

      <p>"Whereas, everything Alan has done with other women has been with my full approval. I may not know every last detail, but there's no real duplicity or treachery going on. In fact, I've encouraged him every step of the way. You see, we're a family - a real sharing family. If Alan were my lover but not theirs, we would have all kinds of problems. Sharing is the only way to go here."</p>

      <p>Brenda was silent, since she didn't know quite what to think about that.</p>

      <p>Suzanne continued, "So, as you can see, our life histories are pretty similar. The big difference is that now I have Alan."</p>

      <p>Brenda said wistfully, "What I need is my own Alan."</p>

      <p>"My thoughts exactly! In fact, you need someone exactly like Alan. Too bad Alan is already taken, several times over. Someone like him would turn your life around. Of course, I'm not talking about the superficial things, like age or looks. It's the stuff inside that counts. The key thing for me with him is that he's just such a GOOD person. He doesn't care for power, wealth, or status. I think he saw what Susan and I went through, and he's been lucky to learn what really matters at a much younger age than you or I did. He knows it's about family and love. If his loved ones are unhappy, he's unhappy."</p>

      <p>Unexpectedly, Suzanne added, "And sex!"</p>

      <p>"Excuse me?"</p>

      <p>"Sex! Sex is key. It's like the glue, the bond, that holds it all together. I don't think you can have a happy couple without sex, particularly if one of them wants sex in their life. If you do, then they're just roommates and not really a couple. With sex we reaffirm and strengthen our loving bonds every day. And it's a hell of a lot of fun!"</p>

      <p>They laughed.</p>

      <p>Suzanne continued, "So what you need is a man who has good values, not superficial ones. And he has to be someone you find attractive. And someone who can ring your bell over and over, if you know what I mean."</p>

      <p>Brenda said with chagrin, "Basically, Alan."</p>

      <p>"Pretty much. Unfortunately, there aren't many Alans out there. But I've found mine, and with the right attitude, lots of work, and knowing where to look, I'll bet you'll be able to find yours."</p>

      <p>Brenda said anxiously, "I hope so. The fact that I have a teenage son already, that doesn't help matters."</p>

      <p>"No. But I believe there's someone out there for every lonely soul. Or, in Alan's case, someone for several lonely souls." She chuckled.</p>

      <p>Brenda asked, tentatively, "Um, you don't have to answer this, but just how many lonely souls do you think one person can satisfy?"</p>

      <p>"Hmmm. In Alan's case, who knows? I do know I'm much, much happier sharing him than having someone like my so-called husband Eric all to myself. The sharing has so many benefits. To give you an example, Susan was already my very best friend before this all started. I thought we couldn't possibly get any closer. But then we both started sharing Alan, and we've gotten MUCH closer! We spend even more time together every day, and we're constantly talking about the sexy, fun things we did with him. It literally doubles the joy, because I get to do something with Alan, and then later I get the joy of reliving it by talking about it with Susan."</p>

      <p>She added, "Of course, that wouldn't work for some personality types. We're lucky in that our group, or family, we mesh so well. Different strokes for different folks, as the saying goes. There are a lot of different ways to find happiness."</p>

      <p>"That's true," Brenda agreed.</p>

      <p>Brenda and Suzanne continued to talk about this and that. Mostly, they focused on Brenda's problems. Suzanne tried to stress that it would be difficult to find the kind of man she wanted and needed, and in the meantime she needed to get in contact with her sexual side and "go a little wild." Once she "found herself" sexually, that would make it easier to know what she wanted with her ultimate mate.</p>

      <p>There was much that Suzanne refrained from saying. For instance, she didn't bring up Brenda's apparent submissive tendencies, even though she was tempted to. She reminded herself that her scheme wouldn't come to fruition in one day, so today she was planting seeds that would flower in the future.</p>

      <p>Suzanne's goal was to give Brenda the idea that the person she should "go a little wild" with was Alan. Furthermore, she wanted Brenda's desire for Alan to grow and grow. It didn't take a big mental leap to conclude that if Brenda's ideal mate was a man "exactly like Alan," who better fit that description than Alan himself? Once Brenda was under Alan's spell, her knowledge of the incest would no longer be a threat. Ideally, Brenda could find a role as a kind of associate to Suzanne's new sexual family, benefitting from it in many ways without being a core member who took up a lot of Alan's time and energy. Suzanne considered the fact that Brenda had a teenage son to be a potential bonus, because it would hopefully keep Brenda occupied much of the time so she wouldn't be too clingy or upset about not being a core member.</p>

      <p>Suzanne wouldn't have considered this possibility for Brenda if it had been just a matter of the incestuous secrets that Brenda had learned. But Brenda was also extremely impressive in several aspects: her beauty, her under-appreciated intelligence, her kind nature, her wealth, and her potential for sexual awakening. Add to that that Brenda was so similar to Suzanne and Susan in many ways, even to coming to many of the same conclusions about what was most important in life. Brenda's sexually submissive nature was essential, because Suzanne believed that she and Alan would be able to control her and thus prevent her from getting out of line or causing lots of problems.</p>

      <p>Suzanne hadn't worked out all the answers when it came to Brenda, but she had a gut feeling that things were working in a direction that would make everyone involved very happy, including Brenda. In fact, in the same way that Suzanne felt that Susan's sexual awakening would ultimately end up being the best thing that ever happened to Susan, Suzanne thought that Brenda's life could be radically transformed for the better too.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_8">CHAPTER 8</h2>

      <p>Susan had told Alan and Katherine to be home from their S-club meeting by five o'clock. With school ending at three o'clock, that gave them less than two hours for another m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois at Kim's house under the cover of the S-club meeting.</p>

      <p>Had Alan gotten together with Kim and Katherine one day earlier, there would have been a lot of weariness. Katherine was still recovering from the drilling of a lifetime on Monday. Kim also wasn't used to being fucked, and so had taken some time to recover. But by Thursday afternoon they were both hot to trot.</p>

      <p>Not so for Alan. He'd recovered from Monday reasonably quickly, but Wednesday had been another intense day for him. He'd had seven orgasms, which was tiring enough, but they were all very intense and prolonged. He decided he needed to pace himself.</p>

      <p>Alan and Katherine had been dropped off at school that morning, which left Alan wondering how the two of them would get to Kim's house after school. But Katherine said she'd take care of it.</p>

      <p>When Alan finished with his tennis practice, he went to meet his sister in the student parking lot, as she'd requested. To his surprise, Kim was there too.</p>

      <p>Kim immediately grabbed his arm and led him towards her car. "Nice to see you, big guy. In short, Katherine and I decided that we need to maximize every minute together since our time today is so short. That's why we'll be taking my mother's old SUV and Katherine will be driving."</p>

      <p>Alan looked as clueless as he felt. "Katherine driving? I don't understand. It's still the same distance to your place no matter who drives there."</p>

      <p>By this time, they'd reached Kim's car. Kim said as she opened the door to the back seat, "Yes, but think of all the precious minutes wasted while you were driving last time. Minutes that I could have spent with your cock in my mouth."</p>

      <p>Alan looked around frantically to see if anyone was within hearing range, but no one was even close. "But..." he protested. "But, I need to take it easy."</p>

      <p>Kim practically shoved him into the far back of the car where there was a lot of room. Meanwhile, Katherine hopped into the driver's seat and started the engine.</p>

      <p>Before the car even began to move, Kim had Alan's shorts off and his erection in her hand.</p>

      <p>But Alan was serious about taking it easy, and especially not overtaxing his dick. He convinced Kim that he could do a good job of "warming up" her pussy with his fingers.</p>

      <p>The only problem for Alan was that when they were about half way there, Kim took her top and bra off and said to Katherine, who was driving the car, "You know what I've always wanted to do but never had the guts to do?"</p>

      <p>"What's that?" Katherine asked.</p>

      <p>"Press my breasts against the window of a moving car, flashing everyone in sight!"</p>

      <p>Katherine enthused, "Oooh! What a great idea! Boy, Kim, I wish you were driving 'cos I'd love to do that right now!"</p>

      <p>Alan complained, "Kim, I hope you don't think you're actually going to go ahead with..." His voice trailed off because she was already doing it.</p>

      <img id="kim013c" class="center" src="part13a/kim013c.jpg" title="kim013c" alt="Kim in her mother's car, topless, pressing her breasts against the window, flashing everyone " />

      <p>Kim's breasts were small by Alan's lucky standards, only B-cups, but pressed against the car window they looked to be a size or two bigger.</p>

      <p>Alan responded with increasing panic, "Kim, you can't do that! Everyone will see! We're getting closer to your house all the time; these could be people you know!"</p>

      <p>Kim giggled, "What people?"</p>

      <p>She had a good point. The car was well into the suburbs now, and she was pressed up against the passenger-side back window that looked out onto the sidewalk, not the one which faced cars coming the other direction. But the streets were deserted and there weren't even many other cars passing them.</p>

      <p>Alan was aroused by the display, but didn't want to admit it. He moaned, "I give up. The whole world's gone insane."</p>

      <p>Kim joked, "I don't care if you give up talking, but don't give up fingering! I'm having the time of my life here!"</p>

      <p>Indeed, Kim was so aroused, especially by the three or four minutes she'd sat with her boobs plastered against the window, that it took Katherine and Alan some effort to talk her into putting her top back on long enough to go from the car to her house.</p>

      <p>But as soon as the three of them got through the front door and closed it behind them, all bets were off. Katherine and Alan were panting with excitement, but Kim's lust left theirs far behind.</p>

      <p>Kim practically tackled Alan to the floor and had him naked from the waist down before he knew what was happening. She fell on top of him, and sucked like her mouth was a black hole deep in space, pulling in all adjacent matter.</p>

      <p>After only a minute or two, she went so deep that she started to gag and had to pull back a bit.</p>

      <p>Katherine leaned in and kidded, "Save some of that for the rest of us, okay?" After Kim failed to answer, Katherine started to get annoyed. "Kim, don't we want to move this from, like, two feet from your front door?"</p>

      <img id="kim003c" class="center" src="part13a/kim003c.jpg" title="kim003c" alt="O: Kim talking just after lifting her mouth from Alan's cock " />

      <p>"Sorry," Kim said as she briefly and reluctantly took Alan's dick out of her mouth to talk. "It's just that I'm so excited. This is, like, a feast! I have no idea how you can manage to live in the same house as him. I'd be sucking him off twenty-four hours a day."</p>

      <p>Katherine leaned in and giggled. "You'd be surprised how accurate that is sometimes. But do save some for the rest of us, okay?" She began taking her clothes off and helping Kim out of her clothes, too.</p>

      <p>Alan had to force Kim to take it easy as well, because her great zeal already had him on the edge of climax. He didn't want to shoot all his loads from blowjobs instead of fucking. He added, "Yeah. Not that I don't love it, but can we at least make it to your bedroom?"</p>

      <p>Kim got up from the floor and led the other two upstairs to her room. Even though she was excited about her newfound discovery of penises and wanted to do nothing but play with Alan's all afternoon, she was mindful not to neglect Katherine. By no means was she suffering from that obligation - it was like choosing your second flavor of ice cream instead of your favorite.</p>

      <p>So, when Alan declared he needed a rest to recover his energies, Kim turned her attention to his sister. As soon as Katherine sat down on Kim's bed, Kim yelled, "Yee-hah!" and jumped on her. She went after Katherine with abandon.</p>

      <p>Now Alan was the odd one out, but he didn't mind. After everything that had happened to him lately, he wanted a more mellow sexual experience, plus he really did need the break. So he just sat and watched Kim and Katherine, who were in a sixty-nine, while he slowly stroked himself.</p>

      <p>After five minutes or so, the two girls calmed down enough to remember again that he was there and see what he was doing. While they continued to mainly go after each other, they made sure to keep a hand or mouth on him as well so he wouldn't have to masturbate.</p>

      <p>They went on like that for quite a while. But although Kim was still bursting with excitement, Alan set the pace and generally kept the sexual fun languid and slow. They spent much more time talking and lightly caressing each other than they did seriously fucking.</p>

      <p>Alan didn't want to fuck just yet, as he wanted to save that for the finale. So, after about half an hour when the other two were looking for something different to do, he suggested, "Hey, I've got an idea. I know your pussies are sensitive and sore from Monday. Let's try titfucking. Have either of you done that before?"</p>

      <p>"No," Katherine admitted.</p>

      <p>Kim also shook her head no.</p>

      <p>Katherine was unreasonably afraid that her breasts would be too small to give a good titfuck. But she was slightly encouraged by the fact that she knew they were much bigger than Kim's. At least, for once, she didn't have to be compared to the likes of Susan and Suzanne.</p>

      <p>She said, "Sounds weird. But if it makes you feel good, I'm all for it. I want you to fuck any part of my body, any way you want, any time you want. It's part of my fuck toy code."</p>

      <p>"Me too!" Kim agreed. "I don't know about this fuck toy business, but I'm quickly learning that anything involving either of you doing anything to me is great."</p>

      <p>Alan naturally started with his sister. He poured some baby oil on her chest. Then, while he sat on her stomach and pounded into her ample cleavage, Kim lay between Katherine's legs and licked her slit.</p>

      <p>Katherine was soon rendered nearly insensible from the double attack, with drool literally rolling down her chin.</p>

      <p>Once she'd had a nice orgasm, she and Kim switched positions. Kim had the smallest pair of tits Alan had titfucked yet, but she made up for that by cocksucking him at the same time - there was no way she was going to let an opportunity of having her mouth that close to his erection go to waste.</p>

      <p>A titfuck was something new for both women, and they decided they really got off on it.</p>

      <p>Kim pointed out, "That's one thing at least that a man could do that no dildo could compare with. I've gotta admit, the hot flesh of a cock pressed between my boobs is so much better than cold plastic put in the same place."</p>

      <p>Katherine joked, "I like it too, except for the fact that there's not even the slightest chance that I could get knocked up that way."</p>

      <p>She loved talking about getting pregnant at every opportunity when she was having sex with her brother. Alan didn't like that very much, but he tolerated it because he knew it was something she really got off on.</p>

      <p>Alan's dick was still in a bad way and it still hurt for him to ejaculate or pee. But the three of them kept going anyway. He remained hard nearly the entire time, and all three of them had fun trying to keep his prick fully stimulated and aroused without actually taking him over the edge. Even when they mostly just sat and talked, at least one of the girls had a hand was on his manhood the whole time, lightly caressing it. He felt he could live like that all day long, staying in a low level erotic buzz from morning to night.</p>

      <p>Kim too, was in heaven. She just couldn't get over how much she loved cocksucking. She still considered herself a lesbian, in that she really didn't like men. She certainly didn't want a boyfriend; she strongly preferred the company of women. All she wanted from a man was a cock to suck and fuck, without the hassle of actually having to go on dates and the like. She realized this "S-club" arrangement was perfect for her, so she stayed on her best behavior to make sure it would continue.</p>

      <p>Kim also took advantage of Katherine's tiredness to monopolize Alan's dick most of the time, sucking it until her mouth muscles couldn't take it anymore. She sucked him slowly and backed off when necessary to prevent his orgasm. For her, taking it easy amounted to lazily licking it, or failing that, rubbing it against her cheek. She was constantly rewarded by a slow drip of pre-cum into her mouth.</p>

      <img id="kim025c" class="center" src="part13a/kim025c.jpg" title="kim025c" alt="V: Kim fucking herself up and down on Alan's pole while he lies on her bed" />

      <p>Although there was a lot of cocksucking and titfucking, Alan made sure that the finale for each woman was a good fucking: Katherine in regular, missionary position intercourse and Kim cowgirl-style. He shot one load into Katherine but with Kim he used a condom. This delighted Katherine to no end, that he was going bareback only with her.</p>

      <p>Kim, though, didn't mind, because in the end she pulled off him, removed the condom, and had him ejaculate into her mouth. She just couldn't guzzle down enough of his sweet cum.</p>

      <p>Despite their exhaustion, they were all very disappointed when their relatively short "S-club meeting" had to end. They felt like they could have kept at it for a full afternoon, slowly fucking, sucking, talking, and just hanging out.</p>

      <p>As Kim drove them home, Katherine thought about their driver. She was surprised at the change that had come over Kim. Katherine had barely known Kim before they became sexually involved, as they'd only been cheerleaders together for a couple of weeks prior to that. Her first impression had been that Kim was an evil bitch, working hand in hand with Heather to make her a sex slave. But that turned out to be completely wrong. In fact, it was remarkable just how fawning Kim had become to both the Plummer siblings, but especially to Alan.</p>

      <p>In this latest "S-club meeting," Kim seemingly all but worshipped Alan and his dick. She'd run to the kitchen to get him drinks or snacks, wiped his forehead with a cool towel after he sweated, licked his cock clean after each orgasm, and generally treated him like a king.</p>

      <p>Katherine could relate to that, because she'd been acting towards him more and more like that herself lately. She reflected, <em>There's something about getting a really, really good fucking. There's a bonding that takes place. Not only that, but you're ready to do anything to get it again. I hope Kim doesn't get more possessive and try to take my brother away. If that happens I'm not going to let go of him without a fight!</em></p>

      <p><em>But what am I thinking? There's no way she can steal him, not with what he's doing to Mom and Aunt Suzy, and somewhat with Aims. Why the hell would he give up having four beauties in his own house for anybody? That's one benefit of having to share. I may not get all of him, but I'm pretty much guaranteed to get a good piece of him.</em></p>

      <p>Alan had also noticed Kim's new subservient attitude. Though he wasn't the type to be rude or demanding, he was curious, so experimented a bit with what she would do. Unfailingly polite, he nonetheless started acting more assertive, saying things to Kim like, "Boy, I could really use some juice." He noted that Kim would hop up immediately and run downstairs to get the juice. She also would take any sexual position he asked, unquestioningly.</p>

      <p>She acted even more eager to please than Katherine, which was saying something. He noted the irony that while Katherine loved to talk about being a fuck toy, she generally didn't act that subservient or submissive. He was glad, too, because he loved her just the way she was, personality-wise, and didn't want to see a big change.</p>

      <p>The whole experience presented him with much food for thought. He didn't want to turn into a selfish asshole and realized he'd have to pay attention to that possibility.</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_9">CHAPTER 9</h2>

      <p>Later that evening, Susan found herself deeply conflicted. On the one hand, she had really enjoyed the tuck-in and goodnight kiss that she'd given Alan earlier in the week, and wanted to make it a regular event. But on the other hand, she knew that she had a tendency to lose control around him, and she was very aware that Ron was still at home. She was also still feeling uneasy about her nightmare of giving Alan a blowjob while Ron slept next to her, and she remembered her vow to avoid helping Alan sexually, for the next few days at least. Yet she knew he needed her help to reach his daily target, particularly while Suzanne was being forbidden to help him as a form of punishment.</p>

      <p>In the end, she decided to compromise: she would go give Alan a tuck-in and goodnight kiss. Maybe she could inspire and encourage him a little, but limit herself to doing nothing more than that. To make sure that was the case, she would wear a heavy robe over her nightgown to be doubly safe from losing her clothes.</p>

      <p>She kept busy in the common rooms, doing chores while dressed in her nightgown and robe, until her husband had fallen asleep. Then she went to her son's room and quietly knocked on the door.</p>

      <p>"Tiger? You still up?" She knew he was despite the late hour because his light was still on, but she felt obliged to ask.</p>

      <p>"Yeah, sure Mom. Come on in."</p>

      <p>She went in and found him already in bed, under the covers. "Hi, Tiger. I thought I'd come in and give you another tuck-in and kiss... If that's all right?"</p>

      <p>"All right? I love it! And I love you."</p>

      <p>"Awww, you're so sweet. No wonder Suzanne calls you her 'Sweetie.'" She saw he'd been reading something, so she asked, "What are you up to? A reading assignment? I'm so proud of you."</p>

      <p>In fact, Alan had been looking at the naked pictures of Suzanne that she'd taken for him recently. He didn't want to share that fact without Suzanne's permission, but luckily he'd put the pictures in other reading material. Unluckily, that happened to be one of the pornographic magazines Susan had bought him some weeks back.</p>

      <p>"Um, well, actually..."</p>

      <p>Before he could figure out what to say, Susan had a closer look at what he was holding and realized what it was. "Oh. I see. A, uh, blue magazine. I'm sorry for prying."</p>

      <p>"No, it's cool, Mom. You're cool. It's just that, I still haven't made my target for the day. So, I, uh..."</p>

      <p>She put on her most stern, motherly face. "Tiger, what did I warn you about spilling your seed upon the ground?"</p>

      <p>"But Mom! What am I supposed to do? I can't just cum on a beautiful woman every time I want! I mean, I'm beyond incredibly lucky already to get all the help I've been getting, but sometimes there's still going to be times like these. I mean, six times a day! SIX times!"</p>

      <p>She tut-tutted, "Well, that may be, but I still disapprove. I wish I could help you myself, but unfortunately your father is still here. And I made myself a solemn vow this very morning to not help you that way for a while. Until your father is gone, at the very least. And you know the situation with Suzanne - that she's being punished."</p>

      <p>"Bummer! Well, couldn't you at least help with some visual stimulation? Isn't that less sinful than using a magazine? And anyway, what's with your get-up? Are you wearing a robe AND a nightgown? Mom, really! I feel like you're afraid of me or something."</p>

      <p>"I'm sorry. It's just that things have gotten out of control lately and I feel the need to establish firm boundaries. I suppose I got a little carried away. Here. Is this better?" She took off the robe.</p>

      <p>"Not really. That's one of your old nightgowns, the kind an Eskimo would reject 'cos it's too warm. Mom, if you're worried about losing control, you can't hide under ten layers of clothing. I mean, you're still going to be helping me in that way once Father is gone, right? And what about the weekly abnormality check?"</p>

      <p>"Well, that's true," she conceded, quite reluctantly. She didn't like where the conversation was going; she suspected that she'd find herself completely naked before too long. In fact, she felt a strange urge to go back to her room to put on her high heels, since she somehow felt even more naked when wearing just heels.</p>

      <p>He suggested, "Why not do what Aunt Suzy was doing Sunday night and test your willpower? Strengthen it. We can work together to establish firm boundaries!"</p>

      <p>Her pussy and nipples started to tingle. She asked suspiciously, "Does this involve me taking off my nightgown?"</p>

      <p>"Well, yeah, but I promise you won't touch my member, since you don't want to. We're just looking for visual stimulation here. And you can't exactly sneak back into your room and pick out something sexy with Father sleeping there, can you? Wouldn't it just be better to take the nightgown off?"</p>

      <p>"I don't know. It just somehow doesn't seem fair to your father. He's only here this one last night, you know."</p>

      <p>"I know, Mom, but what's worse? Me committing the sin of Onan right before your eyes, or you feeling like you've embarrassed Father when he's sleeping through everything anyway?"</p>

      <p>"Well, if you put it that way, I guess it would be irresponsible to knowingly let you sin like that." She pointed at him sternly. "But no penis contact! Right? Not even with a sheet in the way."</p>

      <p>"Right."</p>

      <img id="susan108c" class="center" src="part13a/susan108c.jpg" title="susan108c" alt="Susan, standing naked, looking down bashfully" />

      <p>She removed her heavy nightgown and found herself standing by her son's bed stark naked. She felt extremely awkward. She loved baring her body for him, but she also felt sinful and guilty. "I was afraid something like this was going to happen. Let's at least get this over with quickly. Now, what am I supposed to do?"</p>

      <p>He had been working to get her clothes off and hadn't really thought beyond that point. He admitted, "I don't know, Mom. I mean, having a centerfold mom standing right here makes it hard for me to think. I dunno... Say and do sexy stuff. Meanwhile, I'll stroke myself."</p>

      <p>She loved that he called her a "centerfold mom." He'd recently called her his "beautiful centerfold mom" too. Hearing such high praise made her sensitive nipples tingle. She shifted her weight from hip to hip; even just that was an extremely arousing sight.</p>

      <p>She stared at the large bulge under his blankets and noticed it was moving. "Oh dear. Well, I suppose there's no alternative to you doing that. Boy, it looks like some kind of trapped animal under there. Oh my! Son, you're just so virile. ... Now, let's see. ... You want me to say something sexy?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah. ... I dunno... Maybe... Oh, I know! Why don't you tell me what you'd like to do if you could do anything without worrying about boundaries?"</p>

      <p>She thought about that, and then said in a sexier voice, "Well, Son, I came in here to tuck you in. But basically, I can't tuck you in with that big lump under your sheet. I need to smooth that lump down. Mommy wants to pull down that sheet and find out just what's causing that lump!"</p>

      <p>"It's my penis, Mom. It's hard."</p>

      <p>She was starting to get into the spirit of things, and found herself swaying back and forth to a song that was playing in her head. (The song was "Centerfold" by the J. Geils Band, inspired by his "centerfold mom" comment.) She didn't know much more than the chorus, which she altered to:</p>

      <p class="verse"><em>Her son is bold<br />
      His mommy's gonna do what she's told<br />
      His mommy is a centerfold<br />
      Mommy is a centerfold<br />
      Na na, na na na na<br />
      Mommy is a centerfold!</em></p>

      <p>She said, "Oh dear! Well then, Mommy would just have to help make it go soft again. Good thing I've been taking cocksucking lessons from Suzanne. I'd just bend over you, letting my tits dangle..."</p>

      <p>"Can you show me? That's not touching, if you just show me that."</p>

      <p>"Well, okay, but only because you're such an adorable cutie. Suzanne is right: you are a Sweetie." She leaned over his bed, dangling her nipples within inches of his face. She thought excitedly, <em>This is probably the kind of pose a real busty centerfold makes!</em></p>

      <p>When she did that he pulled down his blankets, but in deference to her no-touching vow he left the sheet where it was, covering everything from his chest down. Then he kept his hands outside the sheet, using it to gain more traction with his visible stroking.</p>

      <p>"God, Mom! I love it when you do that. So what else would you do?"</p>

      <p>"Well, I think I would feel like kissing your belly button. I'd kiss you there, and then kiss and lick my way down, down, down. Would you like that? Would you like your mommy to lick her way down to your big cock? Mommy would! She'd love it!"</p>

      <p>"I'd love it too! Then what?"</p>

      <p>Suddenly she frowned. "Tiger, I'm worried. Thinking back, sometimes it can take AGES for you to cum. Am I going to be wiggling here naked for ten minutes or more? What if your father wakes up to go to the bathroom?"</p>

      <p>"We could speed it up. You know how much I love your breasts. What if you really get them jiggling? Bouncing up and down, even."</p>

      <p>"Tiger! That's so naughty." She began shaking and jiggling. "So dreadfully naughty. What you're suggesting is completely undignified. I'm your mother! It's bad enough that you talked me out of my clothes and are making me stare at your hands stroking up and down that magnificent bulge. Now you want me to jump? I suppose in your perverted mind I should do something like this?"</p>

      <img id="susan131c" class="center" src="part13a/susan131c.jpg" title="susan131c" alt="Susan naked, jumping so that her tits swing up" />

      <p>She started bouncing up and down. Her breasts were so big that they flew around in all directions like independent entities. Sometimes they went round and round in circles together, and sometimes they moved to separate rhythms and even crashed into each other. Whatever they did, Alan loved it as long as they stayed in motion.</p>

      <p>She continued to speak as she jumped lightly. "I'll tell you right now, this is what it might look like if I agreed to your sinfully twisted suggestion, but I'm not going to do it. You can't treat your mother like some piece of meat! No! A thousand times no! I'm not... going... to... jump... for... you!"</p>

      <p>She punctuated each word in that last sentence with a particularly big jump.</p>

      <p>Of course her words were in jest and they both knew it. But such protests made everything that much more fun.</p>

      <p>She stopped jumping, since having her huge tits flail around like that hurt a lot.</p>

      <p>Alan got up briefly, moving away from her to turn on his stereo. He selected the funky song "Tear the Roof Off the Sucker (Give Up the Funk)" by Parliament-Funkadelic.</p>

      <p>Seeing his erection bob all over as he walked from and to his bed sent Susan's arousal up another level. She noticed he didn't get back under his sheet when he returned to bed, so his hard-on stayed jutting up for her to see, but she didn't say anything about it.</p>

      <p>She stood there for a moment, listening to the song. "Hmmm. Interesting music. It makes me feel..."</p>

      <p>"Funky?" he helpfully suggested.</p>

      <p>"What's that mean?" There were some major gaps in her musical knowledge.</p>

      <p>"'Funky?' Hmmm, that's a tough one to define. But it definitely makes you want to move your feet and dance. Listen to the beat and see what it does to your body."</p>

      <p>She started to dance. She was tentative at first, but the song had such a compulsive groove that she started to really get into it. She sexily ran her hands up and down the sides of her body, repeating the motion several times. In the most sultry voice she could conjure up, she asked, "So what do you think of your mommy now, Tiger?"</p>

      <p>"My God, Mom, you're the most lovable, sexy person in the whole wide world!" He was still happily stroking his erection. He was so excited from her display and words that his fingers were getting soaked from all his pre-cum. He was already having to fight off the urge to climax because he didn't want the fun to end.</p>

      <p>She raised her hands above her head and kept dancing. "How am I doing? Am I funky?"</p>

      <p>"Mom, you're totally funky! I had no idea you had it in you. The way you move your hips, you could be a belly dancer! You know, this band has a saying: 'Free your ass, and your mind will follow.' Or maybe it's 'Free your mind, and your ass will follow.' I forget. But either way works."</p>

      <p>"It does!" she exclaimed as her naked body continued to writhe and groove. "I really do feel free. This is so liberating! It's fun!"</p>

      <p>She continued to dance until the song ended. Then she went to the stereo and turned the music off, because she was a bit exhausted and didn't want to be tempted to dance some more.</p>

      <p>Walking back to her son, she put her hands on her hips and said proudly, "So how do you like your 'centerfold mom' now?" Then she added shyly and tentatively, "Did you really mean that? Am I your centerfold mommy?"</p>

      <p>"Totally!" He'd been steadily masturbating throughout her dance, loving every second. But now he stopped and reach out to her. He touched her knee, which seemed safe enough, but then he traced his fingers up her leg, hip, and right across her taut tummy. He wanted to go still higher to her fantastic rack, but that was out of reach for him in his prone position. "Mom, you're a total hottie. I say with complete sincerity that you could win Playboy's Playmate of the Month right now."</p>

      <p>As she saw him sit up, she took a step back and said, "You're too kind. You can't really mean that. Although, did you know, both Suzanne and I have been asked at various times to pose in magazines. Maybe I could have been a real centerfold mommy!"</p>

      <p>"Really? That's exciting! Why didn't you ever tell me about that before?"</p>

      <p>"Well, it's all rather improper, isn't it? It's not the kind of thing a mother usually talks about with her son. Besides, I was offered a lot of money at various times, but it could have just been hot air. Or even some kind of evil scam. Suzanne made sure I always said 'No,' no matter what promises they made. Anyway, I like this little goodnight-kiss tradition. Let's not go too far and blow it, especially with your father so close to leaving."</p>

      <p>He gave up his plan to touch her some more, at least for now. "Whatever you want, Mom. Though in reality I'd be very happy if you 'blow it.'" He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.</p>

      <p>She laughed and playfully pretended to be upset. "Why, all I came in here to do was to give you a goodnight kiss. I hope you're not thinking of doing something naughty."</p>


      <h2 id="chapter_10">CHAPTER 10</h2>

      <p>He was so overcome with emotion that he suddenly turned serious. He reached out and grabbed one of her arms, pulling her close. "Mom, let me tell you something important." He leaned closer to her face, while she leaned in towards him. He was nearly overwhelmed by her sexy scent. She was a little bit sweaty, which he loved. "I love you so much. You're in my thoughts every single minute of the day, either consciously or unconsciously. Just the knowledge that you're nearby gives me confidence and lifts my feet as I walk. I really mean that."</p>

      <p>She was bent over to have her face level with his. Her impressive melons swayed pendulously. She caressed his cheek with a hand while staring lovingly into his eyes. Tears started to flow down her cheeks. "I wish I could express my feelings for you as beautifully as you just did, but I can't even begin to find the words to explain how I feel. Son!" She grabbed him and held him close in a tight embrace.</p>

      <p>She pulled his face directly into her impressive cleavage. The sexual contact was mostly inadvertent on her part, but not completely so.</p>

      <p>He could hear her sob. Even though his face was smothered by tit-flesh, it never occurred to him to take further advantage of the situation - his concern for her emotional well-being preempted his lust. Besides, unless he screwed up big time, there would be other, better opportunities in the future.</p>

      <p>He pulled her head back and once more they stared into each other's eyes. They visually probed each other's faces, staring deeply, as if staring straight inside one another's souls.</p>

      <p>Without warning, she tilted his head up and kissed him squarely on the lips. Their mouths locked and their tongues probed hungrily. Soon, she dropped to her knees next to the bed so she could continue the kissing more comfortably.</p>

      <p>At first, he contented himself with just enjoying the kiss. But his erection was still jutting up, and it still felt great for him to stroke it. So he resumed doing that with one hand while his other hand held her chin or cheek.</p>

      <p>Their kissing went on and on for many long minutes.</p>

      <p>As they kissed, Alan found himself thinking of Ron, who was sleeping just down the hall. He had nightmarish visions of him bursting into the room (though in fact the door was locked). He hated the danger of their tryst, but at the same time he couldn't deny that it made everything that much more intense and arousing. His heart swelled with triumph to know that his mother couldn't resist him despite the substantial risk.</p>

      <p>The kissing felt so good that eventually he gave up the struggle of trying to hold back his climax. He bunched the sheet over his erection. The wet stain already on the sheet suddenly became a much bigger wet stain as he just kept stroking and cumming until he had nothing left to give.</p>

      <p>Susan's eyes had been closed for almost all the kissing, and her hands had never left Alan's face or neck area, but somehow she sensed when he came. She was filled with a satisfying "mission accomplished" feeling, which gave her the strength to pull away and regain control. They'd been French kissing for over five minutes.</p>

      <p>She looked away from him shyly. "Tiger, we shouldn't have done that. The boundaries."</p>

      <p>"But we didn't break the boundaries. You didn't so much as touch my erection. There's nothing wrong with kissing. You should be proud of your self-control."</p>

      <p>She was happy about that, but she complained, "And I let you commit the sin of Onan right in front of me! You spilled your seed upon the ground!"</p>

      <p>"Upon the sheet, actually."</p>

      <p>"I know. But that's how the Bible verse goes. I feel terrible. You should have said something, and I would have let you cum on me. Suzanne says it's okay, as long as it ends up on a woman."</p>

      <p>He really regretted that missed opportunity, but it was too late now.</p>

      <p>"And what about your father down the hall?" She couldn't help but notice the similarities between her recent nightmare and the real life events that were happening at that minute.</p>

      <p>"Do you feel bad about that? He's still asleep."</p>

      <p>"I do. I do! I feel horrible. But the thing is, I don't know how to put into words just how much I love you. But I can express it with my body. When I make you feel good with my body, I feel so good, and I feel like we're as one. I love you so much. So much more than just as a son, or as a lover, or as both combined. It's so much more." Her confidence boosted, she looked back at him.</p>

      <p>He caressed her face and hair with his hands. "Mom, you just expressed it beautifully. I couldn't have said it any better. I feel like that with you, Aunt Suzy, Katherine, AND Amy. Physical pleasure just strengthens a much deeper bond. But I feel it especially with you. I just want to touch you and hold you 24 hours a day. I know it's wrong, but I want to feel like you're mine and I'm yours. Don't tell the others this, but I just don't think it's possible for me to ever love anyone else as much as I love you right now."</p>

      <p>She started to cry tears of joy. "You make me so very happy! Son! I love you so much!"</p>

      <p>They kissed on the lips again. He rolled on top of her and generally had his way with her body although, as usual, he avoided touching her pussy area.</p>

      <p>She pulled away when they could no longer breathe, laughing to herself. "I don't know what I was expecting when I came in here, but I wasn't expecting this. I was terribly tempted the whole time to give you a blowjob or handjob to show you my love. But don't you feel this kissing was much better?"</p>

      <img id="susan109c" class="center" src="part13a/susan109c.jpg" title="susan109c" alt="Susan crying in Alan's embrace" />

      <p>"I do. I've never felt so close to you." He really meant that, and everything else that he'd said.</p>

      <p>They hugged tightly again and again. Neither of them ever wanted to let go. She particularly loved the sensation of lying naked underneath him; it made her feel like she totally belonged to him and was helpless to resist his lusty desires.</p>

      <p>He could sense she was shedding more tears. He tried to focus on remaining sensitive and responsive, although her erect nipples poking into his chest made it hard to concentrate.</p>

      <p>She was lost in thought for a while, then said, "I keep on doubting the wisdom, the morality, and the prudence of doing these things, particularly the physical part. Every time I do them I end up feeling so good. So right. At this point my real loyalty should lie with YOU, not with Ron, because of what he's done. You need me. Your penis needs my help to get rid of all that nasty cum, while he apparently doesn't need me for anything. I guess I'm just a trophy wife for him. But I keep having ... issues! You wouldn't believe some of the dreams I've been having lately."</p>

      <p>She shivered as she recalled (vaguely) aspects of her most recent "nightmare," where Alan took advantage of her in her bed while Ron was sleeping right next to them. "Please be patient with me. It's hard to overcome my past beliefs and my marriage vows, however inappropriate they might seem now. It takes time."</p>

      <p>"That's okay, Mom. We have lots of time. Especially now that Father will be gone soon." His hands continued to caress her bare back while she fondled his ass.</p>

      <p>All this talk about her husband had her worried. She managed to get out from under him, then looked nervously at the door. "I'm really pushing my luck with these late-night visits. I should go. Goodnight, my love. Until tomorrow, when you-know-who finally leaves. Finally!"</p>

      <p>She stood up, then put her nightgown and robe back on. Then she looked at the big wet spot on his sheets. "You want me to take care of that?"</p>

      <p>"Yes, please! Oh, you mean the sheet?" He grinned at his joke.</p>

      <p>"Oh, you! You're incorrigible. The sheet, you nasty, cum-filled boy. Let me put that in the hamper and I'll get you a fresh one."</p>

      <p>She took the soiled sheet, got him a new one, then turned out the light as she left his room.</p>

      <p>Alan's penis had stayed flaccid since his climax, but he was still in an erotic mood. Even just watching Susan in her nightgown while changing the sheets was arousing for him. Now that she'd left, he hugged his pillow tightly, wishing it was his mother and that they were sleeping in the same bed.</p>

      <p>He thought, <em>I just had a similar experience of deep connection the other day when I made love to Sis. I didn't realize that it was possible to completely and utterly love more than one person at the same time, but now I know that it is. I think I love four women. Aims maybe not as much, 'cos I know her the least, but I even love her a lot. Things wouldn't be complete without her. I don't know how I'll ever be able to part with any of them.</em></p>

      <p><em>Hell, maybe five, because what about Glory? Dang! Is it possible to love four or even five women at once? That's nuts!</em></p>

      <p>He had no shortage of amazingly arousing things to think about, so had to will himself to put everything out of his mind to get some rest. Eventually he fell asleep with a big smile on his face.</p>
